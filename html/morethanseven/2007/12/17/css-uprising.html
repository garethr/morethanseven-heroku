          <p>For those not following along closely I thought it worth highlighting some interesting goings on around the web. <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> put the <span class="caps">CSS</span> cat amongst the W3C pigeons with a couple of posts; <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/css_unworking_group/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Unworking Group</a> and a following up <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/csswg_proposals/"><span class="caps">CSSWG</span> Proposals</a></p>
          <p>How I&#8217;ve had a <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/css-snapshots-css3-modules-and-an-agile-way-forward/">few ideas</a> myself previously around what I&#8217;d like to see from the CSS3 working group. I&#8217;m now avidly following along with <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/comments/csswg_proposals/">the comments</a> and I&#8217;d urge anyone working even on an occasional basis with <span class="caps">CSS</span> to do the same.</p>
          <p><a href="http://webkit.org/blog/">Maciej Stachowiak</a> said a few very interesting things in the comments I thought worth commenting on:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Being an expert user is not necessarily enough to know how to extend it. A key part of extending a technology is knowing how it works on the inside.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I think their-in lies an opportunity. The weight of comments on this issue, and the heat of the argument, would suggest people are interested. But I think a-lot of those interested parties are those working day-in with <span class="caps">CSS</span> (rather than on it) and lack this critical information. As a web designer how do I find this information out? Who are the interesting bloggers in the area of standardisation? Is their are good reference site? Or a wiki? Or an active friendly mailing list of people willing to answer simple questions? The web (standards) design community is used to open discussion and debate &#8211; whether from blogs or projects like <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a>.</p>
          <p>You could of course also argue that <em>being an expert implementer is not necessarily enough to know what needs extending. A key part of extending a technology is knowing what is needed first in the real world</em>.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>But the cost of a serious mistake in a standard is much higher than the cost of an implementation bug.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I think this depends on the software in question &#8211; what about critical military systems, satellites or space shuttles, power stations, etc. &#8211; but I agree in principle. Most web designers do not have the experience of working on this sort of software project. But then Andy is not putting himself up as a project management guru.</p>
          <p>Their are obviously strong feelings on both sides of this debate. But something I would be interested to hear &#8211; from someone with a standards focus &#8211; is whether you think their is a fundamental problem at the moment with regards <span class="caps">CSS</span>? If not then why not? If so then what are your ideas for moving forward?</p>
          <p>And feel free to say you don&#8217;t know yet. I think what Andy has done is put down his ideas. If you don&#8217;t like them then suggest better ones. If that&#8217;s sticking to the status quo then say why you it feel will work out.</p>
          <p>(I&#8217;ve posted the above in the comments to the original post, but wanted to repeat it here more in the hope of getting more interested people involved in that thread.)</p>
          <p>I don&#8217;t really expect Andy to have the answers to this issue, but by him kicking the discussion off in such a public way the least we can <em>all</em> do is have the debate we need and come up with the solutions for everyone. Especially on the  list of <em>getting started with standards</em> links and reading materials alluded to above, if someone has this information but not the time to get it online in a coherent fashion, or to present it to the wider community then please get in touch.</p>
