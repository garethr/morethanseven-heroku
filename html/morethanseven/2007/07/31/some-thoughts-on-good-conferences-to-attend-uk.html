          <p><a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/index.php/2007/07/31/some-thoughts-on-good-conferences-to-attend/">Ben Metcalfe</a> just posted a run down of some thoughts on conferences to attend. With all my travels this year I thought I&#8217;d join in.</p>
          <p>I&#8217;ve spend quite a bit of time this year travelling the UK for various get togethers, conferences, meetups and the like and had great fun doing so. I go mainly because nowhere else do I find quite such a critical mass of smart interesting people to have a pint with and discuss the intricacies of the web. For 2007, in roughly chronological order: <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/">WebDD</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">Barcamp London</a>, <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps</a>, <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com">Highland Fling</a>, Refresh Edinburgh, <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007/">@media</a>, <a href="http://www.hackday.org/">Hackday</a>. I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a>, Future of Web Apps (again) and possibly <a href="http://www.future-of-mobile.com">Future of Mobile</a> and a Rails meetup in London as well to finish off the year.</p>
          <p>I won&#8217;t go on about how cool <a href="http://barcamp.org/">Barcamp</a> was. I actually think the whole unconference thing sits alongside the more formal conference scene quite nicely rather than acting as a direct challenge. Safe to say if you have yet to make a Barcamp then be on the lookout (although if you could not pick brighton please. I really want to go and it&#8217;s going to be hard enough to get tickets anyway!)</p>
          <p>Highland Fling was excellent. Alan did a bang up job of picking a pretty focused topic and getting a gang of safe hands in to do the talking. Everything seemed to follow on from the previous talk, or catch a thread only touched on earlier in the day. This turned out to be down to the specific topic rather than some pre-conference collusion which I thing bodes well for other such topic centric mini-conferences. It was all rounded off (as all conferences must be) with a rousing talk from <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> and a panel chaired by <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy <del>Paxman</del> <ins>Keith</ins></a>.</p>
          <p>@media is still the daddy of the UK web standards scene. Personally I want more advanced materials and I&#8217;d love to see more audience interaction, but the scale of it makes that a little difficult I acknowledge. I&#8217;ll keep going as long as I learn something new and come away feeling a little bit inspired. I&#8217;ll be going next year. Maybe it&#8217;s not going to hit the heights of the very first @media a couple of years back but that was my first trip out into the world. Oh, and <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/">patrick</a> throws good parties in pubs with beer.</p>
          <p>I think dConstruct is basically a grown up Highland Fling. It was great fun last year so here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s as much fun this year. Again, the idea of a particular topic is in place. I&#8217;m still thinking about <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/">@media Ajax</a> if I can get enough work together to pay for it (note to people trying to keep up &#8211; I now <a href="http://garethrushgrove.com">work for myself as a freelancer</a>) and I have a sneaking suspicion I&#8217;ll want to get along to <a href="http://www.future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile</a> in a couple of months too.</p>
          <p>My plan for next year is to try and get out of the country and hopefully to some of the events in the US and Europe that offer something different. <a href="sxsw.com/"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a> is an obvious choice, but I&#8217;d be interested in any other ideas on top of Ben&#8217;s list. I&#8217;d also like to think in a year of so I might even end up talking at some nice event or other &#8211; but I need to pick a topic and stick to it I reckon instead of flitting between whatever I feel like that afternoon. Oh and probably practice.</p>
