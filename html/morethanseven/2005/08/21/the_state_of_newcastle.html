          <p>I&#8217;ve been a practicing web designer/developer/whatever in Newcastle for over three years now and about a year ago I set up a mailing list to try and act as a useful resource, shamelessly stealing from <a href="http://brightonnewmedia.org">brightonnewmedia.org</a></p>
           <p>So was born <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia.org</a>.</p>
           <p>The grand plan was to find other people like me with an interest. Anyone I could learn new bits from and hopefully the utopian dream of everyone getting something out of particupating in a community. It&#8217;s been, I guess, something of a partialy something. Traffic goes up and down depending on, well I dont really know. Hopefully it&#8217;s been useful on occasion.</p>
           <p>One issue was I never really promoted it. So, with a little time on my hands rather than redesigning this site (again) I did a little work freshening up the website, adding a showcase of local designers personal sites in the process and the plan is to promote it a little. Hopefully get some more people on their and in particular some students from the local Uni&#8217;s &#8211; quite a few of which teach something along the lines of web design but approach it in wildly different ways &#8211; something I might write about next.</p>
           <p>Anyway, I guess the main aim is to get a snap shot of the industry and in particularly the people who make up the industry, in and around the North East. Are their people in their bedrooms going crazy <span class="caps">CSS</span> zen Garden designs? Are their any <span class="caps">DOM</span> Scripting leviathans? British web designers seem to be the cream of the crop, or at least make up a decent percentage of the cream (why do Standards based design analogies always end up being <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/web_standards_trifle.html">cake related</a>?), but where are the Northern designers, never mind the North East.</p>
           <p>Anyone else think differently? Let me know. Send me sites of designers and developers in and around the North East and I&#8217;ll post them into the <a href="http://www.newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia.org</a> site and we shall see.</p>
