          <p>Another project I hacked together on the train running on App Engine I&#8217;m afraid. Anyone getting bored of my <em>new project each week</em> posts please stop reading now.</p>
          <p><a href="http://gitbug.appspot.com"><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjZNgw" alt="GitBug interface"/></a></p>
          <p>Issue or bug tracking is just one of those things we all deal with and probably have opinions on. Lots of open source software exists (<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">BugZilla</a>, <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>) to do the job and various companies have commercial products (<a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a>, <a href="http://sifterapp.com/">Sifter</a>, <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/products/fixx/">Fixx</a>). So why did I go and create another one?</p>
          <p>Certainly not because I think I can do a better job for the majority. This is very much a personal pet project and I don&#8217;t very much fancy competing with teams of smart people building good products.</p>
          <p>Like most software projects my issue tracker was designed to scratch a personal itch. I now have 28 repos over on <a href="http://github.com/garethr">GitHub</a> (how did that happen?). Some of these are public projects I&#8217;d like other peoples input on, and for me that means having a public list of issues. But these aren&#8217;t active projects being worked on by a team of people &#8211; it&#8217;s mainly just me (with Brad and Simon occasionally correcting my spelling and grammar) hacking on the train to work and back. I don&#8217;t need collaboration features. I don&#8217;t want to be limited to a small number of projects. I&#8217;d rather not pay lots of money, or worry too much about hosting.</p>
          <p>So that&#8217;s where <a href="http://gitbug.appspot.com">GitBug</a> comes in. Bug tracking for people with minimal needs.</p>
          <p>The only real <em>feature</em> past a very minimal bug tracker is the ability to close bugs via a GitHub webhook. Oh and lots of <span class="caps">JSON</span> and <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds for everything but that&#8217;s just the way we should build things now anyway.</p>
          <p>Their are areas of the interface that could do with some streamlining and a couple of open bugs that don&#8217;t yet cause me enough pain to fix. I have however opened it up for anyone with a Google account to use and a few people have started adding their own projects and issues already. I&#8217;m hoping that for the most part by keeping it as simple as possible I can avoid having to do any work on <em>it</em> and work on bugs in other projects instead, of which I&#8217;m sure there are many.</p>
