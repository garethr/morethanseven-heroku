          <p>I like adding images to the occasional blog post but don&#8217;t do it as often as I want to. The reason being I can hardly ever be bothered to resize images. It means opening up a memory hogging application, fiddling around for a few minutes and then saving it out somewhere, then uploading said image to my server. All of those things bore me.</p>
          <p>Appengine to the rescue. As an excuse to play around with the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/images/overview.html">image <span class="caps">API</span></a> as well as add more pictures to this here blog I decided to build myself a small image hosting application. I really only care about the two things noted above; resizing and uploading. If I can do that in one go I&#8217;m happy.</p>
          <p>A couple of train rides (all the best code gets written on train journeys, fact) later and I&#8217;ve deployed the first version of Image Host which looks a little something like this:</p>
          <p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjtBww" alt="Image Hosting interface on Google App Engine"/></p>
          <p>(And yes that image is an image of image-host hosted on image-host. If you&#8217;re thinking <em>what image?</em> then it means this experiment isn&#8217;t working at the moment.)</p>
          <p>The application is designed in such a way as you could have as many people uploading and managing their own set of images as you want, all within one instance. The only reason I don&#8217;t just open it up to any google user account is that it would eat into my quotas if it got popular and I have no interest in policing whatever dubious images anyone might upload.</p>
          <p>I&#8217;ve been playing with App Engine quite extensively of late. I really appreciate the <span class="caps">SDK</span> and the limited, but well designed and thought out APIs and testing stubs. At the moment I&#8217;m happy with where it&#8217;s at. It&#8217;s obviously early days but in my mind all I really want are APIs for offline processing, some sort of message queuing facility, <span class="caps">XMPP</span> support and a payment model for raising the limitations. And several of those are already slated for the near future.</p>
          <p>If anyone wants to host their own version you can grab the code from <a href="http://github.com/garethr/appengine-image-host/tree/master">GtHub</a>. You&#8217;ll need your own App Engine account and your own snappy name but that&#8217;s all. If you really don&#8217;t want to do that, have a good reason to needing image hosting and ask nicely I might add more people to my version as well.</p>
          <p>Their are a few bugs I&#8217;m going to fix when I get a moment,  a few documented limitations I know about and I&#8217;m still fleshing out the test suite to cover all the functionality. But all in all a worthwhile few hours spent hacking. I&#8217;ll probably get round to writing up some pointers for testing App Engine code as well as their are a host of gotchas and the only real documentation at present is comments in the code.</p>
