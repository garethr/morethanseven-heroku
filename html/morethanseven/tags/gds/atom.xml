    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we shipped "GOV.UK":https://www.gov.uk. Over the last year we've built a team to build a website. Now we're busy building a culture too. I've got so much that needs writing up about everything we've been up to. Hopefully I'll make a start in the next week or so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog post is mainly an excuse to use the pun in the title. It's also an opportunity to tell folks that don't already know I'll be starting a new job on Monday working for the UK Government. I'm going to be work for the "Government Digital Service":http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/, a new department tasked with a pretty wide range of sorting the Government out online.</p>

<p>The opportunity is huge. And when it came around I couldn't turn it down. I'm going to be working with a bunch of people I've "known":http://memespring.co.uk/ "and":http://nicepaul.com/ "respected":http://fberriman.com/ for a while, as well as other equally smart people. That means I'm going to be back in London again as well.</p>

<p>Hopefully I'll be able to talk lots about what we're up to. The groundwork for that has already been laid by the "alpha.gov":http://alpha.gov.uk team who have been blogging furiously about topics of interest.</p>
