    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago now "Vagrantbox.es":http://www.vagrantbox.es/ (a website I maintain for third party hosted "Vagrant":http://vagrantup.com/ base boxes) dissapeared from the internet for a few days. This was completely my fault, the (lovely) hosting people "ep.io":https://www.ep.io/ had unfortunately closed down the service they had in beta and I'd been so busy that I hadn't had chance to move it elsewhere.</p>

<p>The original version of the site (I had the code and good backups of the data) was a pretty simple Django application, but I'd used it to experiment (read over-engineer) with various bits of tech including Varnish, Solr, some ORM caching and lots more. This had been great, but it made it less portable. I had everything described in Puppet, but with virtually no spare time I decided to go a different route.</p>

<p>I threw a flat version of the site up on "GitHub":https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku, served it using Nginx on "Heroku":http://www.heroku.com/ and added a quick <em>Fork me on GitHub</em> badge to the top. Suggest a box moved from being a web form to a pull request. It's fair to say I did this pretty quickly and made a good few typos on the way. But within a couple of weeks I've had 8 pull requests either fixing my bugs, removing dead boxes and adding new ones.</p>

<p>What I'm going to take from this is, if you're building a community project that's aimed at developers, then throw the content on GitHub. In my case I have the entire site on there too but I think that's secondary. Pull requests are much better than any content management system or workflow you're likely to build, and even more importantly the time to implement something drops hugely.</p>

<p>With all the spare time I don't have I'll be thinking about a content management model using GitHub for content, pull requests for workflow and post commit hooks for loading that content into a site or service somewhere.</p>

    <link href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/05/08/Vagrant-plugin-for-interacting-with-vagrantboxes/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/05/08/Vagrant-plugin-for-interacting-with-vagrantboxes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After "Patrick":http://www.jedi.be/blog released "Sahara":https://github.com/jedi4ever/sahara/, a nifty extension for the "Vagrant":http://vagrantup.com command line tool, I've been meaning to put together a similar extension for interacting with the growing list of base boxes on "vagrantbox.es":http://www.vagrantbox.es.</p>

<p>After a bit of hacking this morning I've just pushed out an initial release of the "vagrantboxes gem":https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrantboxes and you can find the "source code and some documentation on GitHub":https://github.com/garethr/ruby-vagrantboxes.</p>

<p>The extensions adds a vagrantboxes namespace to the vagrant command line tool which provides a few useful commands. Specifically you can list all the available boxes, do text searches, show the full details of a box and most handily of all add a box that takes your fancy to your local base box store, all without having to worry about the URLs of the boxes if you don't want to.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a simple search:</p>

<pre>>> vagrant vagrantboxes search centos
3    centos 5.5                http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15307300/vagrant-0.7-centos-64-base.box
6    opscode centos 5          http://opscode-vagrant-boxes.s3.amazonaws.com/centos5-gems.box
7    opscode ubuntu 10.04      http://opscode-vagrant-boxes.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu10.04-gems.box
9    puppet centos 5.5 64      http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/centos5_64.box
10   puppet centos 4 64        http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/centos4_64.box
21   centos 5.6 32             http://yum.mnxsolutions.com/vagrant/centos_56_32.box</pre>


<p>And another quick example, this time of show printing the full description. In the future I might look to store more structured metadata and make this more useful.</p>

<pre>>> vagrant vagrantboxes show 18
puppet debian lenny 64
http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/debian_lenny_64.box

Debian Lucid 64 bit vagrant box. Puppet 2.6.6 installed and ready to provision using the Puppet provisioner in Vagrant.

For good sample modules, try the jeffmccune-motd and jeffmccune-mockbuild modules posted to http://forge.puppetlabs.com/

Created by Ken Barber, ken@puppetlabs.com</pre>


<p>This proved a good excuse to delve into the Vagrant source code which is pretty readable for the most part once you understand the libraries it's build upon. It's simple enough to extend for adding commands like this too, which bodes well for other more useful additions in the future.</p>

<p>If anyone has any problems with this extensions do let me know. Error handling currently consists of returning blank output rather than sensible error codes or messages, and as I've yet to add a small test suite so their might (will) be a few bugs lying around. I'll try and make it better behaved in the next week or two but reasoned it's useful straight away.</p>

    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/04/02/Vagrant-at-the-guardian</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As recent blog posts on here make clear, I'm a big fan of "Vagrant":http://vagrantup.com. And when "Michael":http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/ asked if I'd fancy talking to some of his colleagues at The Guardian about how I use it I really couldn't say no.</p>

<p>I gave a short talk, running through the following slides, and running a few demos showing creating, destroying and provisioning new machines.</p>

<object id="__sse7492432" width="595" height="497"> <param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=vagrant-110402104037-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=vagrant-and-configuration-management&userName=garethr" /> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/> <embed name="__sse7492432" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=vagrant-110402104037-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=vagrant-and-configuration-management&userName=garethr" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="595" height="497"></embed> </object>


<p>More interesting I thought were the questions and conversations that followed. We talked a little about how Vagrant might fit into a continuous integration setup. Another aspect some of the systems folk took to was how flexible the network configuration was and whether they might be able to use this to more effectively test firewall configurations well before the final push into a production environment. It's not something I've been doing but it sounds feasable and useful in some organisations. If anyone is doing interesting things with Vagrants network config I'd be interested to know.</p>

    <id>http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/03/12/Site-for-vagrant-base-boxes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A brief "conversation with Matt Keating":https://twitter.com/#!/garethr/status/40785392445685760 on Twitter finally pushed me over the edge and I've built a site I'd been meaning to do for a while.</p>

<p>I'm a huge "Vagrant":http://vagrantup.com fan, but one thing that often comes up is where to find base boxes. My newly launched site "Vagranbox.es":http://vagrantbox.es provides just that. At the moment that just means user submitted boxes being checked and then posted. I'll likely add comments and ratings and the like if things become popular but that's for later.</p>

<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjBuwEM" alt="vargrantbox.es homepage"/></p>

<p>So, if you know of or host a useful box please let me know. I'll try to keep up with any submissions.</p>
