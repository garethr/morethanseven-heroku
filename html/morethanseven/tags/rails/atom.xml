    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Building larger applications tends to mean splitting your codebase up some how into manageable chunks. I'm quite interested in what I see as different approaches in the Rails and Django communities:</p>

<p>Django tends to recommend building "Reusable Apps":http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/mar/27/reusable-django-apps/ and we have sites like "Django Pluggables":http://djangoplugables.com/ to catalog what's available. You then grab a few of these applications from the web or write your own, add them run them all together as part of a single application. "Pinax":http://pinaxproject.com/ is probabaly the poster child for this approach. The  0.5.1 release for instance appears to have 41 individual reusable apps, many written by other people and projects.</p>

<p>The Rails community tends to "talk more about RESTful service orientated architectures":http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/08/activeresource-rails-scalability.html, with things like "ActiveResource":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html making this sort of thing easier. So rather than your manageable chunks being within your application they're separate instances in their own right.</p>

<p>I'd be interested in hearing from more people about their experiences, in particular if you've gone against the grain so to speak.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was always a fan of "Rail environments":http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Environments and as part of some work upgrading this site to the latest version of Django I decided to clean up my whole deployment process. Part of that involved replacing everything in settings.py with the following snippet of code:</p>

<p>pre. ENV = "development"
try:</p>

<pre><code>exec "from environments." + ENV + " import *"
</code></pre>

<p>except ImportError:</p>

<pre><code>print "You must specify a valid environment"
exit()
</code></pre>

<p>I now have two settings files stored in an environments module containing all the usual django settings; one for my development environment and one suitable for live. The settings.py above is for my local development environment, with only one small change for live (this file doesn't get deployed along with the source code for the site, so doesn't get overwritten).</p>

<p>pre. ENV = 'live'</p>

<p>This isn't quite the same as the Rails implementation obviously. I run completely different server setups so I'm not too bothered about a flag on the runserver command like the -e flag for mongel. I could also probably do something to autodetect the environment but this works fine for me.</p>
