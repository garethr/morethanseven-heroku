    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been pretty busy with all things "GOV.UK":https://www.gov.uk recently but I've managed to get a few bits of unrelated code up and a few talks in. I'm <em>still</em> pretty busy so here's a list of some of them rather than a proper blog post.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Puppet Data Mining":http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/mining-puppet talk from last weeks PuppetCamp in Edinburgh.</li>
<li>"Introducting Web Operations":http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/web-operations talk I gave at work to give my mainly non-development colleagues an idea about what it's all about.</li>
<li>"Learning from building GOV.UK":http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/learnings-from-govuk talk I gave a month back or so to Cambridge Geek Night. We did an excellent full project retrospective after the beta launch and this lists some of the things we learnt.</li>
</ul>


<p>After someone bugged me on Twitter I realised the small bit of code we've been using for our Nagios dashboard wasn't out in the wild. So introducing "Nash":https://github.com/garethr/nash, a very simple high level check dashboard which screenscrapes nagiosand runs happily on Heroku.</p>

<p>Although I've not been writing too much on here I've been keeping "Devops Weekly":http://devopsweekly.com/ going each week for over a year now. I've just crossed 3000 subscribers which is pretty neat for a pet project.</p>
