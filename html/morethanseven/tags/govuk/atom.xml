    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago I had the good fortune of speaking at the "London Web Performance":http://www.meetup.com/London-Web-Performance-Group/ meetup. This was one of the first talks I've done about our work at The Government Digital Service since the luanch of GOV.UK back in October. The topic was all about moving quickly in a large organisation (The UK Civil Service is about 450,000 people so I think it counts) and featured just a hand full of technical and organisational tricks we used.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we shipped "GOV.UK":https://www.gov.uk. Over the last year we've built a team to build a website. Now we're busy building a culture too. I've got so much that needs writing up about everything we've been up to. Hopefully I'll make a start in the next week or so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a bit of a cheat blog post really. I've been crazy busy all month with little time for anything except work (specifically shipping the first release of "www.gov.uk":https://www.gov.uk/). I have had a little time to blog over on the Cabinet Office blog though, about work we've done with dashboards.</p>

<p>If you're ever looking for good little hack projects dashboards are perfect, and often hugely useful once up and running. Convincing people of this before you have a few in the office might be hard - so just build something simple in a lunch break and find a screen to put it on. We've had great feedback from ours, both from people wandering through the office and from our colleagues who have a better idea of what's going on.</p>
