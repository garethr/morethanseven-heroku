    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we shipped "GOV.UK":https://www.gov.uk. Over the last year we've built a team to build a website. Now we're busy building a culture too. I've got so much that needs writing up about everything we've been up to. Hopefully I'll make a start in the next week or so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a bit of a cheat blog post really. I've been crazy busy all month with little time for anything except work (specifically shipping the first release of "www.gov.uk":https://www.gov.uk/). I have had a little time to blog over on the Cabinet Office blog though, about work we've done with dashboards.</p>

<p>If you're ever looking for good little hack projects dashboards are perfect, and often hugely useful once up and running. Convincing people of this before you have a few in the office might be hard - so just build something simple in a lunch break and find a screen to put it on. We've had great feedback from ours, both from people wandering through the office and from our colleagues who have a better idea of what's going on.</p>
