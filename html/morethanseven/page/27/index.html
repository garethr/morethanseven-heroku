  <div class="entry-content"><p>As mentioned when I moved the site over to Radiant I promised a few tutorials and behind the scenes footage of goings on. So here goes with a quick look at how I added a nice <a href="http://morethanseven.net/friends.opml"><span class="caps">OPML</span> feed</a> to my site.</p>
 <p>For those not familiar with <a href="http://www.opml.org/"><span class="caps">OPML</span></a> it&#8217;s an <span class="caps">XML</span> format for outlines, often used for storing blog rolls and the like.</p>
 <p>What I wanted was a friends parent and the ability to add friends to it and for them to appear in a dynamic <span class="caps">OPML</span> feed. The following screenshot shows what I ended up with:</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFriendsFeed.png" alt="Tree showing Friends feed in Radiant" /></p>
 <p>To accomplish this within Radiant I needed a custom layout, one which would simply render the content but also had the relevant header and footer markup. Note the mime type setting as well.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOpmlLayout.png" alt="Layout for OPML in Radiant" /></p>
 <p>Next up is the page which actually uses the <span class="caps">OPML</span> layout to render the page.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFriendsFeedCode.png" alt="friends feed from Radiant" /></p>
 <p>Note that I set the status of all the friends records to hidden, and then set the status of the r:children:each loop to search for hidden children. This way the individual friends records dont show up as seperate pages.</p>
 <p>All I need to do then is add children to the parent, friends-feed in my case. I added a few page parts to each friend page to make management a little easier; a <em>link</em>, a <em>feed</em> and for a little added spice <em>xfn</em>.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgEditFriend.png" alt="Edit friend view from Radiant" /></p>
 <p>All in all it makes adding and updating friends easy, and the general approach will work with pretty much any content where you want to compose a single page based on it&#8217;s children.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m starting to get properly interested in CSS3 for a few reasons. I&#8217;ve subscribed to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists.html#www-style">mailing list</a>, read up on some of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">working group goings on</a> and done a bit of research ahead of really jumping in with some code play. Some of this could be of interest to others so here goes:</p>
 <p>The best two resources I&#8217;ve found are the <span class="caps">CSS</span> Working group home page and the <a href="http://www.css3.info/">CSS3 Info</a></p>
 <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Working Group Under Construction</a> site over at the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a> has a huge ammount of information. For those that dont know <span class="caps">CSS</span> is being split into a number of distinct modules, namely:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Advanced layout</li>
  <li>Aural Style Sheets</li>
  <li>Backgrounds and Borders</li>
  <li>Basic User Interfaces</li>
  <li>Box Model </li>
  <li>Cascading and Inheritance</li>
  <li>Color</li>
  <li>Fonts</li>
  <li>Generated Content for Paged Media</li>
  <li>Generated and Replaced Content</li>
  <li>Hyperlink Presentation</li>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Line Layout</li>
  <li>Lists</li>
  <li>Maths</li>
  <li>Multi Column Layout</li>
  <li>Namespaces</li>
  <li>Object Model</li>
  <li>Paged Media</li>
  <li>Positioning</li>
  <li>Presentation Levels</li>
  <li>Reader Media Types</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Scoping</li>
  <li>Speech</li>
  <li>Syntax</li>
  <li>Tables</li>
  <li>Text</li>
  <li>Text Layout</li>
  <li>Values and Units</li>
  <li>Web Fonts</li>
</ul>
 <p>Phew. Their is also some work going on on profiles for TV, Printed media and Mobile. I&#8217;m interested in a few of these modules &#8211; particularly those dealing with Web Typography and the Basic User Interface module which deals with <em>the look of form elements in their various states and more cursors and colors to describe GUIs (graphical user interfaces) that blend well with the user&#8217;s desktop environment.</em></p>
 <p><a href="http://css3.info">CSS3 Info</a> also has lots of information worth reading, including some good examples of parts of CSS3 that have been implemented ahead of recommendation in the <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/">preview section</a>. My favourite bit however has to be the <a href="http://www.css3.info/selectors-test/test.html"><span class="caps">CSS</span> selector test</a> by <a href="http://rakaz.nl/">Niels Leenheer</a>. You can read a little more about that, and <a href="http://rakaz.nl/item/how_well_do_browsers_support_css_selectors">how different browsers do</a>, or at least how they did in October. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS3/Selectors/current/html/index.html">W3C test suite</a> is available too, but no where near as slick.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve even gone and installed a <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">WebKit nighly build</a> to try out some of the features only supported their at the moment. Who knows? I might even add new designs to the site using new selectors as a treat for those <em>silly</em> enough to be using such experimental browsers.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re viewing this post in your feedreader then you might not notice anything different but it&#8217;s all change around these parts. I&#8217;ve gone all <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a> and with it a new slightly minimal design.</p>
 <p>Radiant, for those that missed my earlier gushing post is a Rails based Content Management System that looks something like this:</p>
 <p><img src="/_assets/media/imgRadiantAdmin.png" alt="Morethanseven admin panel from Radiant" /></p>
 <p>I&#8217;m going to post a few follow ups about how I did certain things using Radiant and my particular setup. All in all it&#8217;s been fun. Always a good sign when developing something. I ported all my old posts across from Textpattern and I&#8217;ve posted a project post (in my new <a href="http://morethanseven.net/projects-feed">project feed</a>) about <a href="http://morethanseven.net/projects/txp2radiant">TXP2Radiant</a> for anyone else looking to do the same.</p>
 <p>Their will likely be a few gremlins lying around that I&#8217;ll get to over the coming weeks, and I have some decent posts in mind to keep people interested. Expect less about what I&#8217;m up to and more about the pressing issues of web design and development that I keep meaning to write about.</p>
 <p>The design is a little on the minimal side at the moment but on purpose. I want to play around with different designs for the site while keeping everything clean and simple. I might even set a file size limit for the <span class="caps">CSS</span> and I definately want to start playing more with CSS3 selectors (more than 80% of you dont use IE6, for the other 20% <em>please</em> upgrade). I&#8217;m not going to say anything I&#8217;d regret, like one new design every other month, but I can dream.</p>
 <p>As I get more familiar with Rails (one of the reasons for the move) and Radiant I&#8217;ll likely add some bits like a <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> powered gallery and maybe something to do with <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> but for the moment it&#8217;s all about the content.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Their is nothing wrong with a nice header graphic. Clients, designers and customers alike love them. But I often see them used as an excuse for fixed width designs. Well no more I say (unless, of course you have a perfectly good reason for a fixed width design in which case you dont really need this technique.)</p>
<p>The plan was simple. Find a way of incorporating flash headers into sites using liquid or elastic designs in much the same way you might use lots of sliding doors background-image goodness.</p>
<p>And all it takes is a snippet of actionscript goodness:</p>


<pre><code>Stage.scaleMode = "noScale" 
Stage.align = "TL" 
var width
var height
function resizeEvent ( ) {
    width = Stage.width
    height = Stage.height
    dimensions.text    = 
       'width : ' + width+ '
        height : ' + height
    topRight._x = width
    bottomLeft._y = height
    bottomRight._y = height
    bottomRight._x = width
}
resizeEvent ( )
var stageListener = new Object ( );
stageListener.onResize = resizeEvent
Stage.addListener ( stageListener );</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://webpy.org">Web.py</a> is a really nice lightweight web framework written in Python. It&#8217;s not trying to be Rails or Django, it&#8217;s trying to be as simple as possible. Web.php is my homage to Web.py. I&#8217;ve unashamedly copied the ideas and build a very simple web framework in <span class="caps">PHP</span>. It&#8217;s not a complete port, nor does it do everything in the same way.</p>
<p>The code example from the project home page was what originally piqued my interest:</p>

<pre><code>import web
urls = (
   '/(.*)', 'hello'
)
class hello:        
   def GET(self, name):
       i = web.input(times=1)
       if not name: name = 'world'
       for c in xrange(int(i.times)): print 'Hello,', name+'!'
if __name__ == "__main__": web.run(urls, globals())</code></pre>
<p>My <span class="caps">PHP</span> versions goes something like this, I&#8217;m sure you can see the similarities:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
require('webphp/web.php');
$urls = array(
   '/' =&amp;gt; 'hello',
);
class hello {
   function GET($path) {
      echo 'hello world';
   }
}
web::run($urls);
?&amp;gt;</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve used it so far on a couple of projects, but it&#8217;s never been properly tested as such nor do I have lots of time to develop it. It&#8217;s purposely feature and code light (the core file is only 80 odd lines of code, includig comments).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having just moved from a couple of year old <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> site to <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a> I didn&#8217;t feel much like copy and pasting lots of articles. The script simply copies all your posts from textpattern into the relevant place in Radiant.</p>

<p>At the moment this is undocumented and pretty rough but it saved me time and works. I&#8217;ll try and work up and potentially rewrite in Ruby for possible inclusion in the Radiant core if time permits.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first real foray into writing some simple Python scripts was a few scripts to establish the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning-Fog_Index">Gunning-Fog</a> index of some given text. I wont go into lots of details about the uses of such a script; if you&#8217;re interested read Gez Lemons <a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/readability.php">writeup</a> over on <a href="http://juicystudio.com">Juicy Studio</a>.</p>
 <p>I took quite a bit of inspiration, and some code, from a similar script, <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/pyflesch/?branch_id=57281&#38;release_id=191977">PyFlesch</a>, for establising the Flesch reading score of text.</p>
 <p>I expanded things a little, using the <a href="http://feedparser.org/">Feedparser</a> module to parse content from <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Atom feeds and give a Flesch or Gunning-Fog score of the summaries.</p>

Although you <em>can</em> make pages public their is currently no way to style those differently, or to add content from outside Backpack. That&#8217;s where Backgarden comes in. It&#8217;s a simple <span class="caps">PHP</span> (4 and 5, the <span class="caps">XML</span>/<span class="caps">XSL</span> implementations are slighly different) application that builds a page via the Backpack <span class="caps">API</span> and some <span class="caps">XSL</span> magic that you can put on your site. You just enter the page address and your <span class="caps">API</span> key.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Content management is one of those subjects I often get involved in at work, and something I find pretty interesting as a whole &#8211; even if I keep having to reiterate most of the problems with content management are people problems rather than technological ones.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> for this site and a few others for a couple of years. I&#8217;ve spoken before about the recent move to more hand rolled solutions, and the flexibility that gives people to innovate. As well as occasionally threatening to really kick the tyres on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> or similar (<a href="www.seaside.st">Seaside</a>, <a href="http://webpy.org/">Web.py</a>, &#8230;). I&#8217;ve been wandering the halls of the web development frameworks all year it seems &#8211; playing with <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> along the way.</p>
 <p>To a point however these seemed more developer focused that something I could see being used by a web designer or small company (some intentionally so in fairness) or in education. However I&#8217;m back playing with Rails and started looking at existing apps to see how they are put together (I love open source) and a quick recce of Rails based <span class="caps">CMS</span> products turned up (amongst others that didn&#8217;t interest) <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a>. It <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2006/09/12/site-launch-at-last/">appears</a> to have been developed along side the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">new Ruby site</a> launched in September and boy is it a nice piece of kit.</p>
 <p>Assuming you have Rails installed, installation of Radiant is as simple as one command (It&#8217;s available as a <a href="http://rubygems.org/">Gem</a>) and then another to get a site up and running (Ok, plus a couple of other simple commands to configure a database). First impressions it looks well put together, with a strong concept well executed and a lovely Interface. It&#8217;s chunky without being cliched and simple without being simplistic. I&#8217;m in the process of making plans for next year and this is hopefully going to feature somewhere. I love looking for a problem where I might just already have the solution.</p>
 <p>Oh, and a only vaguely related note (well, <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> is a content management system of sorts) a couple of friends have started blogging over on <a href="http://breadlinedesign.com">breadlinedesign.com</a> and <a href="http://anotherblog.com">anotherblog.com</a>. Consider this a shameless plug.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m something of a want to be foodie. I&#8217;ve been a fan of food since working in a <a href="http://www.bentleys-foodandwine.co.uk/">restaurant</a> as a KP way back when I was at school. I like staying in and cooking, watching the odd food related progamme and going out to nice restaurants. However, I suddently realised it&#8217;s one of those things I dont yet do online. Most of the other things I do, or am interested in, I do at least in part online &#8211; except food.</p>
 <p>So I set out to see what I could find. I&#8217;d <a href="http://corkd.com/people/garethr/cellar">signed up</a> for <a href="http://corkd.com/">Cork&#8217;d</a> a while back after the buzz around the site in the web standards and Rails community. I&#8217;ve added a few wines and a few drinking buddies and keep thinking I should keep it up to date but&#8230;</p>
 <p>A quick search threw up <a href="http://chugd.com/">Chug&#8217;d</a>, <a href="http://www.menuism.com/">Menuism</a> and <a href="http://www.recipematcher.com/">Recipe matcher</a> to name but a few &#8211; all complete with Web 2.0 cliches. But nothing that really made me want to sign up. I&#8217;m not looking for a food community really, more a useful tool to store food related tit bits. Recipes. Which wine goes with what and when the best time to get perculier beers might be. Like a food focused version of <a href="http://backpackit.com">backpack</a> maybe? A mobile interface, hey maybe even a Palm based data entry setup would top things off nicely.</p>
 <p>Any other food people reading with a workflow that works? We&#8217;re always talking about software workflow or <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">getting things done</a> but what about something important like food!</p></div>
