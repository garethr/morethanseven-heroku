  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apologies up front for the bad pun but I&#8217;ve been busy playing with another little feature found in CSS3, namely the :target pseudo-class.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually pretty well described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/#target-pseudo">CSS3 Selectors module</a>, (although given that the specs make lots of use of partial URLs the spec style sheet is crying out for use of said selector to I digress).</p>
<p>Put simply it allows you to style elements of a page that are the target of in page anchors, ie. <code>&amp;lt;a href="#target"&amp;gt;in page link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</code></p>
<p>For example. The following <span class="caps">CSS</span> hides all div children of an element with an id of <em>example3</em>.</p>
<pre><code>#example3 &gt;div {
    display: none;
}</code></pre>
<p>The we can say &#8220;if said element has been targetted then display them all&#8221;</p>
<pre><code>#example3:target &gt;div {
    display: block;
}</code></pre>
<p>So if you visiting #example3 you would see the divs, otherwise they will be hidden away.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up a couple of examples over on <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/target">morethanseven.net/presents/target</a>.</p>
<p>These examples basically remove the need for Javascript implementations but I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;d actually use either of these. But you get the general idea. One thing about the examples was their simplicity compared with similar approaches though.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already pretty well implemented according to this handy <a href="http://www.css3.info/modules/selector-compat">compatability table</a> from <a href="http://www.css3.info/">CSS3.info</a> and I would imagine an ideal candidate for <a href="http://andybudd.com">Andy Budd&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/05/css22/">CSS2.2</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick, but hopefully informative post on something that took me a little time to work out and I thought might trip a few others up too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m playing with quite a bit of CSS3 at the moment for our <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com">new company</a> site. It seemed like a good excuse to put into practice lots of progressive enhancement and the like and so far is going nicely if I do say so my self.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/">CSS3 Generated Content Module</a> has some nice little bits in and I decided to use it to put some icons after external link ala wikipedia (but with nicer icons). Actually what I wanted was simply an arrow and I didn&#8217;t really need an image for that did I?</p>
<p>Well my first try went a little something like this:</p>
<pre><code>p a[href^="http:"]:after {
    content: "#8594;";
}</code></pre>
<p>Nope, no luck. By the time it hits the browser it&#8217;s not what I was looking for. I didn&#8217;t think old style named entities would work but what the heck?</p>
<pre><code>p a[href^="http:"]:after {
    content: "&amp;rarr;";
}</code></pre>
<p>Nope. As I thought. No luck their either. I also tried the character itself (but forgot to put that in the first post &#8211; thanks <a href="http://joeclarke.org/weblogs/">Joe</a>) but again to no avail.</p>
<pre><code>p a[href^="http:"]:after {
    content: "â†’";
}</code></pre>
<p>Some digging around and I managed to infer the correct syntax from some hidden away examples about something else.</p>
<pre><code>p a[href^="http:"]:after {
    content: "\2192";
}</code></pre>
<p>You need to use the Unicode encoding. Doh. Job done.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For both of you who care what I get up to during my work hours this post is for you. I&#8217;ve finally gotten involved in a new startup with a couple of friends. Look out for <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com">hedgehog lab</a> related goings on in a Newcastle near you. We&#8217;ve got plans being drawn up as I type (multi-tasking) but a smattering of training and consultancy on web standards design and development and a very health dose of some of those new fangled online products (all with as many microformats as I can sneak in) sounds like fun to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/"><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgHedgehogLab.jpg" title="hedgehog lab" alt="hedgehog lab" /></a></p>
<p>Bye bye to all the people at TH_NK. It&#8217;s been great for two years and I&#8217;ll miss the cunning hit and run attacks on asp.net that have yielded some pretty good results. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll get more done without me being quite so obstinate!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the impending job move that has been keeping me so busy. I finally, after much useful feedback and patience from <a href="http://thewatchmakerproject.com">Matt</a> got my first <a href="http://www.digital-web.com">Digital Web</a> article done: <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/apis_and_mashups/">APIs and Mashups For The Rest Of Us</a>. As the title suggests it&#8217;s a quick run through the various goings on, in particular on what I find so interesting about the concepts of Open APIs and this web of data thing. I even squeezed in some talk of <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/apis_and_mashups/comments/">Let me know what you think</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/">Sam</a> as well for a useful early proof read and to <a href="http://www.tiffehr.com/">Tiff</a> at Digital Web (who also has some interesting things to say on this here industry on her new blog, <a href="http://www.lostcog.com/">Lost Cog</a>.)</p>
<p>End of self reverential post. The list of <em>real</em> things I have to blog about is frankly too long to wait around. And it&#8217;s not helped by these <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007">trips</a> to <a href="http://hackday.org">london</a> which frankly just give me even more to write about. Incase anyone is interested (and more to remind me), expect something on automated site testing, some musings and code (!) for doing useful things with microformats, some cool CSS3 (or is it CSS2.2 now?) tricks and something involving flickr which should actually be quite interesting if I get the time.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a quick follow up to my <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/unobtrusive-javascript-example-printing/">previous post on unobtrusive javascript</a> I thought I&#8217;d expand it even more, but this time in an attempt to make it easier to use.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve already mentioned javascript should be treated like any other programming language &#8211; not necessarily left to the experts but their should ideally be an expert involved somewhere along the line. One way of doing this is to abstract out configuration from programmatic logic. This massively helps with code resuse as well, leaving everyone to play to their strengths. It&#8217;s interesting to note that even programmers who would always store configuration settings seperately when writing <span class="caps">PHP</span> or Rails applications don&#8217;t always get around to doing the same in Javascript. Hell, I used to be one of them until <a href="http://wait-till-i.com/">Chris Heilmann</a> pointed out how patently obvious the solution was while at <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/">The Highland Fling</a>.</p>
<p>The answer is <a href="http://www.json.org/"><span class="caps">JSON</span></a>. I think it&#8217;s nearly always easier with a quick example so here&#8217;s the Print snippet from the previous post but this time with a few configurable options:</p>
<pre><code>var Print = {
   config: {
      "id": "iNav",
      "classname": "has-print",
      "text": "Print"
   },
   init: new domFunction(function() {
      if (list = document.getElementById(Print.config.id)) {
         if (list.nodeName.toLowerCase() === 'ul') {
            if (Print.hasClass(list,Print.config.classname)) {
               var item = document.createElement("li");
               item.className = "print";
               var link = document.createElement("a");
               link.href = "#";
               link.onclick = Print.printpage;
               var txt = document.createTextNode(Print.config.text);
               link.appendChild(txt);
               item.appendChild(link);
               list.appendChild(item);
            }
         }
      }
   }),
   hasClass: function(element,cName) { 
      return new RegExp('\\b''&amp;#43;cName'&amp;#43;'\\b').test(element.className);
   },
   printpage: function() {
      window.print();
      return false;
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>The main thing we have done is to add a new block:</p>
<pre><code>config: {
   "id": "iNav",
   "classname": "has-print",
   "text": "brand new text"
},</code></pre>
<p>This is simply a <span class="caps">JSON</span> object of name/value pairs. You can easily alter the right hand values and change the workings of the app. You then reference the settings in  the rest of you&#8217;re code using dot notation:</p>
<pre><code>Print.config.text</code></pre>
<p>In the above example our configuration directives are stored in our Print object. Depending on the circumstances of use you might find it easier to have a seperate Config object which stores all the configuration settings for the entire site.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In lieu of some real posts here&#8217;s a quick code sample to keep things ticking along.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had the need to place a nice print button on a web page from time to time. If you haven&#8217;t you&#8217;re probably alone. A quick google will throw up lots of results for print javascript &#8211; the problem is that most of them are horribly obtrusive.</p>
<p>OK, so it&#8217;s easy to write something like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="#" onclick="window.print();"&gt;print&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>But the problem is <em>What if you turn off javascript?</em> The following unobtrusive script automagically adds a print link to the page &#8211; in this case as part of a list item which is added to the unordered list with the id of <em>iNav</em> and a class of <em>has-print</em>.</p>
<pre><code>var Print = {
   init: new domFunction(function() {
      if (list = document.getElementById("iNav")) {
         if (list.nodeName.toLowerCase() === 'ul') {
            if (Print.hasClass(list,'has-print')) {
               var item = document.createElement("li");
               item.className = "print";
               var link = document.createElement("a");
               link.href = "#";
               link.onclick = Print.printpage;
               var txt = document.createTextNode("Print");
               link.appendChild(txt);
               item.appendChild(link);
               list.appendChild(item);
            }
         }
      }
   }),

   hasClass: function(element,cName) { 
      return new RegExp('\\b'&amp;#43;cName&amp;#43;'\\b').test(element.className);
   },

   printpage: function() {
      window.print();
      return false;
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>With something like this you want it to load as soon as the dom is ready, rather than on page load. <a href="http://www.brothercake.com">Brothercake&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.brothercake.com/site/resources/scripts/domready/">domFunction</a> comes to the rescue here. The namespacing is based on <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org">Stuarts</a> technique which should make it more capable of just being dropped in to any site.</p>
<p>The only problem with this is that it&#8217;s just a little longer than the original. I think this is down to one often missed fact, at least until recently &#8211; Javascript is a programming language and should be treated as such.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://andybudd.com">Andy</a> gave a great thought provoking presentation (exactly what conference presentations should be) at the recent <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/">Highland Fling</a> shindig on the future of <span class="caps">CSS</span> which he&#8217;s written up into a good thought provoking blog post on <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/05/css22/index.php">CSS2.2</a></p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>As web standards developers we want new toys! I took to <span class="caps">CSS</span> because <em>it made sense</em> set against the madness of table based layouts, not necessarily because it appeared easy or flexible. <span class="caps">CSS</span> has turned out to be hugely flexible, but some of that flexibility has come at the expense of some weird and wonderful and successful techniques. I love this ingenuity, I&#8217;d like to think that the original <span class="caps">CSS</span> specification allowed for this cleverness in real world use.</p>
<p>CSS3 has stalled. CSS3 is trying to solve a whole host of massive problems that others are better placed to comment on, but I&#8217;d love to hear some comment from members of the working group. If I&#8217;ve missed a regular blog by a working group member please leave a comment and let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a real believer in open standards and I think that it&#8217;s this issue that worries me more about the pace of <span class="caps">CSS</span> development. Yes, I want new toys, or more specifically I want to be more efficient (yes rounded corners, I&#8217;m looking at you) but actually, I&#8217;d rather have a good CSS3 spec than a fast and loose one. But the immenent fight between Flash/Adobe and Silverlight/Microsoft is showing how productive huge commercial companies can be when it wants to get something done. Both are introducing interesting new tools and allowing for what could be improvements to usability (or horribly confusing interfaces but hey). <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span> should be the glue that binds all this together in a web where everything plays nicely together. But if <span class="caps">CSS</span> provides too little or too late then this is put in doubt. And if <span class="caps">CSS</span> falls I dont see microformats, rdf, html5 or whatever making a real dent &#8211; and I really want a semantic web (upper <strong>and</strong> lower case).</p>
<h3>The Solution?</h3>
<p>Well, I&#8217;d like to say the solution isn&#8217;t <em>Browser Wars II &#8211; A good idea this time?</em></p>
<p>Andy&#8217;s suggestion of an interim step (or steps) between now and CSS3 modules raises a problem. If the working group do the work then it takes their eye further off getting CSS3 modules out. If they don&#8217;t, will they accept suggestions from outside? Will outsiders be able to grok the whole standardisation process?</p>
<p>What we need is a commercial company with lots of smart people and lots of cash &#8211; with a track record of working with standards. A member of the W3C would be a plus. Ideally they should have something invested in the web as a platform, maybe even in a smarter, cleverer, semantic web.</p>
<p>Google to the rescue maybe? If you&#8217;re really cynical you could see Silverlight as an end run around Google&#8217;s apparent dominance of the web as a platform. Lock content away in proprietary silos and traditional search becomes less appealing? And surely Google has lots to gain from the long term adoption of anything that increases the semantic nature of the web. If <span class="caps">CSS</span> is a battleground then maybe they need to come out and make a stand(ard)?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been pondering <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/authoritative-hcards-authority-in-microformats/">authority in microformats</a> and as a result been taking a closer look at <a href="http://microid.org">microID</a>.</p>
<p>The situation I want to find a solution for is; If their are lots of published hcards for a given person they might be different, either out of date or more sinisterly fraudulent. If I do a search for contact details, lets say using the <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/">technorati hcard search engine</a>, how do I know which one is to be trusted?</p>
<p>If I publish an hcard on <a href="http://morethanseven.net">my site</a> using the following markup, including a microID using the included email and url details to form the hash.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div 
   class="vcard microid-mailto+http:sha1:a52b4f86cfa4190b53634d99198c0f56970c8d83"&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="fn"&gt;gareth rushgrove&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://morethanseven.net" class="url" rel="me"&gt;
      morethanseven.net
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net" class="email"&gt;
      gareth@morethanseven.net
   &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If the hcard search engine reads that hcard on the morethanseven.net domain it could check the hash in the vcard against doings it&#8217;s own hash with the specified email address and url (checking the url is the same as the one on which the vcard lives). &#8220;Ah ha&#8221;. It can say. This looks like an authoritive hcard.</p>
<p>This does however raise a couple of issues. In order for the search engine or external reader to be able to create its hash you have to include the email in your hcard. I&#8217;m also not sure it does solve the issue of evil me:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div 
   class="vcard microid-mailto+http:sha1:40b46e5c349453bddd0dbd022fb33488494699cb"&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="fn"&gt;evil gareth rushgrove&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://spammer.com" class="url" rel="me"&gt;
      spammer.com
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="mailto:gareth@spammer.com" class="email"&gt;
      gareth@spammer.com
   &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the above is published on spammer.com then I&#8217;m sunk. It&#8217;s another authorative hcard with the same name, in this case <em>my</em> name. Of course therein lies another problem, when we name our children we tend to just do it on a whim, we even copy names we like from other people! And we change or subvert these names when we dont like them with nick names and the like. Domain names are unique so we avoid this problem.</p>
<p>So, a possible solution does present itself; using the uniqueness of domain names combined with the fact that most people aren&#8217;t evil spammers. Lets postulate a search engine finds lots of hcards for a given name. Most of these hcards probably point back to the url of the entity they are describing (so most hcards on the web describing me point back to this site). We can then check if one of the hcards is from that domain, and if it has a valid microID. In other words we use the lazy web to identify the most likely location of an authorative hcard.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been pondering lots of potential uses for <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a> of late and came up on one thing I thought worth asking what people thought; namely the issue of authority in microformatted data.</p>
<p><a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> provide a very interesting <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/">Microformats search engine</a> that allows you to search for a person and get back their contact details via hcards that it knows about. For instance try doing a <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/rushgrove">search for me</a> and you get seven results (ironic given the domain name), try with one of those <a href="http://adactio.com">famous people</a> and you get <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/jeremy+keith">lots more</a>. This poses a problem, what is the various hcard disagree?</p>
<p>You can always look at the publication date but this might not be enough. I could publish an hcard with incorrect data for anyone right now on this site and it would be more recent that the other, possibly correct, information already available on the web. Note that this isn&#8217;t a problem with Microformats per ce, more an ever present problem with the web. It&#8217;s just that Microformats make the matter more of a potential issue.</p>
<p>Is their a need for the ability to provide an authoritative hCard, or other Microformat instance? One that can always be trusted? If I publish an hcard of my details I&#8217;d like to think the latest version of that would be the most trustworthy. But how do you make a claim of ownership over a piece of data on the web (microformatted or not)? And for some of this data do you need a way of deciding who has access to it and who does not in a standard manner?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty interested in the issue of identity at the moment, spurred on by the likes of <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and <a href="http://microid.org/">MicroID</a>. I&#8217;m wondering if their isn&#8217;t some clever cross over here? Sites like <a href="http://claimid.com/">ClaimID</a> are doing some things in this space already so we&#8217;ll have to see.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://allinthehead.com/">Drew</a> posted a while ago asking <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/301/can-your-website-be-your-api">can-your-website-be-your-api</a>. The simple idea is that you just might be able to live without a dedicated <span class="caps">API</span> in favour of good use of microformats.</p>
<p>It also turns out <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek</a> has also been on the case with his presentation <a href="http://tantek.com/presentations/20040928sdforumws/semantic-xhtml.html">Can your website be your <span class="caps">API</span>? &#8211; Using semantic <span class="caps">XHTML</span> to show what you mean</a> and</p>
<p><a href="http://www.glennjones.net">Glenn</a> has <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=60">spoken on the subject too</a> at <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk">WebDD</a> and <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">BarCamp</a>.</p>
<p>This has interested me for a while and I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to writing some code, in fact I wrote the bulk of it during <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/">The Highand Fling</a> and then the rest before the <a href="http://refreshedinburgh.com/">Refresh</a> event after I got to te venue an hour early.</p>
<p>I used Drew&#8217;s <a href="http://allinthehead.com/hkit">hKit</a> for the microformat parsing so everything that follows is PHP5 only I&#8217;m afraid. The also means I dont have a working example on this server at the moment but you can <a href="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/downloads/microformatsapi/microformatsapi.zip">grab the code</a> and try it out yourself. It also makes use of a couple of <a href="http://pear.php.net"><span class="caps">PEAR</span></a> modules; <span class="caps">PEAR</span> <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Validate">Validate</a> and <span class="caps">PEAR</span> <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request">HTTP_Request</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;ve worked on a simple hCard example. It demonstrates the idea of a website exposing methods based on the presense of microformats, plus using that exposed method to extract the information we&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>First we create objects for the parser and the website:</p>
<pre><code>$parser = new hKit;
$website = new Website('http://morethanseven.net',$parser);</code></pre>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll ask what methods the website exposes:</p>
<pre><code>$website-&gt;expose();</code></pre>
<p>In this example we get back an array of the available methods, in this case <em>getContacts</em>. Then just as an example lets print out some contact details:</p>
<pre><code>foreach ($website-&gt;getContacts() as $contact) {
   echo $contact-&gt;getFN();
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a very early release, more of a proof of concept and as such their is no documentation and only a portion of hCard is supported. Hell, their&#8217;s not even a name beginning with h! Having said that I have a plan for a little project to kick the tyres and so I&#8217;l l be adding to it and hopfully have a proper release at some point.</p>
<p>The plan is to introduce methods like getReviews, getEvents, etc. which allow for the extraction of the relevant details. The part I find most interesting however is the idea of the expose method &#8211; asking a web page if it has an <span class="caps">API</span>, and if it does then what information you can extract automagically. If you&#8217;re interested let me know what you think.</p>
