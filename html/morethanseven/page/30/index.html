  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always take ages to get photos off my camera. It&#8217;s like the sort of delay you would get if you sent them off to be developed. Anyhow, I&#8217;ve finally sorted out my <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> photos and uploaded a few to flickr. Have a look if you feel so inclined. I&#8217;ve included a few below, mainly because these ones made me chuckle:</p>
 <p>A look of sheer horror if ever their was one from <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick</a>.</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/65/190869172_a3a229458d_m.jpg" alt="Patrick H Lauke on the big screen" /></p>
 <p>Is &#8220;Chris Wilson&#8221;: not the spitting image of He Man?</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/63/190868288_530626e765_m.jpg" alt="Chris Wilson" /></p>
 <p>If this isn&#8217;t caption competition material I dont know what is. <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Norm</a> was most definately <em>the man</em> that night.</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/59/190872439_ca8f880df2_m.jpg" alt="Norm. nuff said." /></p>
 <p>Ah. The famous straw incident. Featuring <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">Nic</a> and an awful lot of straws.</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/46/190871829_2445000f09_m.jpg" alt="A drink very very full of straws" /></p>
 <p>And I&#8217;m still trying to decide what was funnier; the fact <a href="http://htmldog.com">Patrick</a> set up a bird bath in the middle of the pub, or the fact it took him and <a href="http://blog.meriwilliams.com">Meri</a> quite a while with the instructions to put it together.</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/72/190878254_6b8f33193f_m.jpg" alt="A bird bath with instructions" /></p>
 <p>Some people have been saying that the socialising is getting in the way of the learning and sundry at these conferences. I&#8217;ve got to disagree. You just cant ignore the socialising, not when it&#8217;s this much fun. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the message doesn&#8217;t get drilled home too.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update</strong> <span class="caps">UCAS</span> to the rescue. Here are lists of graphic design courses and their ilk. Go get em.</p>

</ul>
 <p><a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> posted a <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1149">thought provoking read</a> that tapped into somethings I&#8217;ve been thinking about of late, and others that have been somewhere in my head for a while. In a nut shell:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Most designers have simply swapped the old technology (tables and font tags) for the new technology, without fully exploring whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so completely <em>new</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>I&#8217;ve got to say I tend to agree with pretty much everything Jeremy said. I could pick up on liquid layouts being <em>harder</em> (I dont think that&#8217;s completely true once you&#8217;ve done a good number, it&#8217;s like anything new, it just takes getting your head around) but that&#8217;s just nit picking.</p>
 <p>One thing I will comment on is some of what I see as the reasoning and, if I can think of anything, some things we can do to counter them.</p>
 <p>One issue is that most of the designs are not done by designers in my opinion. I&#8217;m not really sure I count as a designer here, I flit between too many disciplines to be completely comfortable with the title (or most titles to be honest). The perceived technicalities of <span class="caps">CSS</span> (it&#8217;s plain text) can put those without that bend (ie. Photoshop users) off, and at the same time attract people who thing <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> is cool. Combine this with a truly fantastic <a href="http://sitepoint.com">online</a> <a href="http://alistapart.com">community</a> full of <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/">helpful</a> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">tutorials</a> and you have a recipe for technically good, but creatively stunted, websites. Throw into the mix easily replicated techniques (rounded corners and gradients anyone?) and gallery sites with a low barrier to entry and you get to where we are now.</p>
 <p>And I dont really think all of this is bad? Anyone can put together web pages, even half decent web sites. For me that just makes it more fun/challenging to do it professionally and demonstrate real value. Everyone can paint, but how many people can say they can paint well? And I dont mean your skirting boards. Some are already sounding the <a href="http://www.collylogic.com/?/comments/the-end-of-css-showcases/">death knell for gallery sites</a>. The real gallery is and should be the web itself. If design is about communicating, unless your aim is to communicate to other web standards designers, the galleries should be the last thing on your mind.</p>
 <p>But where are the new breed of designers? The people doing the sorts of things that Jeremy wishes were happening right now (or more likely happened last year)? <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk">Malarkey&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321410971/">book</a> will be stunning if the bits and pieces he mentioned at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> are anything to go by, but who is going to force it into the hands of the graphic design student, or the art college graduate. And beat them over the head with it until they are ready to come work with me? Or you? Or me and you if you work with me already.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m now vaguely miffed. I thought right, I&#8217;m going to go and get myself a list of all the uk design degrees and put it up here. People could then leave comments, ring them up and try and get in to speak to these people about web design and report back. If the mountain won&#8217;t come to mohamed and all that. Except guessing and googling didn&#8217;t turn up anything useful. The <a href="http://design-council.org.uk">design council</a> had lots about education (in theory) but then the search facility broke (and the fact it appears to be a table based love child of the old <a href="http://adobe.com">adobe</a> site and <a href="http://bd4d.com">BD4D</a>). <a href="http://www.ucas.ac.uk/"><span class="caps">UCAS</span></a> are doing maintenance and are offline until midnight. I&#8217;ll post a list when I can get by hands on one. Or if you have better luck let me know. Funky logos and pithy slogans can come later, as can a big pile of presentations and materials if anyone, inlcuding me, ever does anything about it.</p>
 <p>So. Who&#8217;s with me? I dont care if your scared of public speaking (or just scared of speaking in general, or even scared of the public). You&#8217;ll know more than the students in any case and that makes you dangerous. And they might have the ideas, and enthusiasm, we need to pass beyond the limits of our current design problems.</p>
 <p><em>I know I went off in something of a straight line here. I made a bee line for design education. I could have detoured to visual design tools or photoshop designers with a loving for print and a propensity to want a 350 page website look like their comps. Both of them. Feel free to go off on a tangent yourselves, and let me know what you think.</em></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love this idea. It has a nice warm fuzzy feeling about it. <a href="http://www.molly.com/2006/06/27/web-professionals-code-of-ethics/">Molly was musing</a> about a code of ethics for <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/11/14/web-standards-and-the-new-professionalism/">professional</a> web developers. Talk went on at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> about certification and education and the like, and the general concensus was pretty negative, for good reason in my opinion.</p>
 <p>However, a code of ethics, more a stamement of intent from professional to professional, strikes me as a really good idea. It&#8217;s easy to forget that it can be difficult when learning (and aren&#8217;t we always learning in this job?) to really get down to best practice. It can be difficult to just do it at times, never mind do it <em>properly</em> what ever that means.</p>
 <p>After reading on the comments I was feeling pretty good, and a few from the bottom I was thinking, I&#8217;ll set up a wiki, as suggested. Well, <a href="http://www.meriwilliams.com">Meri</a> got their first so good job Meri, it keeps it in Newcastle any how. <a href="http://www.meriwilliams.com/ethics/index.php?title=Main_Page">Head over there now</a>, it&#8217;s fairly light on content at the moment but I guess that is the point of this point.</p>
 <p>What do other people think of this anyhow? Now I need to find some time. Or rather more time. I love being all enthusiastic, if only I found the time! I&#8217;m going to have to cut down on sleep, and I so like sleep.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/03/09/391362.aspx">Chris Wilson</a>, during his <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> presentation mentioned in passing the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=D13EE10D-2718-47F1-AA86-1E32D526383D&#38;displaylang=en">IE 7 Readiness Toolkit</a>. This vaguely uninspiring title hides a very nice collection of essential tools for discerning web developers on Windows.</p>
 <p><a href="http://poisonedminds.com/comics/pm20060621.png">IE is painful</a> we already know that. We have a large number of tools available in Firefox to help us out, but sometimes you need to go to the source. Along with a nice <del>rip off</del> <ins>implementation</ins> of a web developer toolbar, it also put me onto <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/">the Fiddler</a> (what is it about these names) which is an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Debugging proxy. What? Well it sits next to IE and monitors all <span class="caps">HTTP</span> traffic, allowing you to find out exactly what&#8217;s going on. Very handy indeed, and worth running just to see what&#8217;s really going on, especially in Ajax land.</p>
 <p>A couple of other interesting tools are included that I&#8217;ve not had a look at yet, the Expression Finder looks particularly interesting. It basically tracks down any hacks in your files and tells you off.</p>
 <p>All in all a good move from Microsoft. What with <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">Open Search</a> being integrated into IE 7 as well, and <span class="caps">RSS</span> maybe reacing a tipping point eventually (Non geeks will believe my predictions one day) things might be looking up.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes folks. <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media 2006</a> is all over. Except for the year thing, everything else really was doubled. Double the people. Double the speakers. Double the number of chairs (no sitting on the floor this time!)</p>
 <p>I made a list of a couple of things to make sure I did. Well how did I do?</p>
<ul>
 <li>Take photos &#8211; Check. I&#8217;ll upload as I get a chance, but in the meantime their are already quite a few over on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/atmedia/">the atmedia flickr tag</a></li>
  <li>More SubEthaEdit note taking &#8211; With the problems with the wi-fi this was held to a single session on <a href="http://nascentguruism.com/files/events/atmedia-2006/20060615-1400-the-new-accessibility-guidelines-wcag-20.txt"><span class="caps">WCAG</span> 2.0</a> with <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve</a> and <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk">Ben</a></li>
  <li>Eat food (You know who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m talking about) &#8211; Again score one. Some photos from a nice mexican place on the Thursday with <a href="http://thinkdrastic.net/">Olly</a> and <a href="http://www.liptrot.org">Adam</a></li>
  <li>Keep updating the syndicator thing &#8211; Again wi-fi problems but I did it each night anyhow. 38 new posts over the few days, and I need to add a few more sites. I do keep wondering about just using Technorati anyhow?</li>
  <li>Watch the football (sorry, it is the World Cup) &#8211; I wont talk about that. Until I switched from drinking Corona to Asashi it was a little dull.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Apart from that I got up to the usual geekery. Met lots of people. Drank a few beers. Went to a few talks and panels.</p>
 <p>I wandered around with a whole host of people. I&#8217;d try and name drop but I&#8217;d miss someone and make them feel bad. Well, ok, probably not but their you go.</p>
 <p>The evening of the first night of the conference was particularly amusing. Wetherspoons for food, a short rant with <a href="http://quirksmode.org"><span class="caps">PPK</span></a> and <a href="http://brothercake.co.uk">James</a> about (what else) Javascript and then spending the evening under the stars with <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick</a>, <a href="http://www.logohere.co.uk/blog/blog.htm">Andy</a> and a few others was, er, entertaining? slightly disturbing? bordering on stalking? All of those and more.</p>
 <p>Their is simply too much to say and too little time. Which sort of explains the lack of details about the sessions and my take on them. I&#8217;ll probably post more about how I think the social side of things really is an integral part of these do&#8217;s, and how <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> really does deserve some sort of medal, and, well, you get the slighty hyper idea. And with my wi-fi hopefully working at home by now keep your readers peeled for both irreverant (sorry &#8211; irrelevant) banter and hopefully a couple of interesting insights and highlights.</p>
 <p>More name dropping next time. Promise. Oh, and leave a comment if I said hi, it&#8217;s always a pleasure guys.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right. It might have taken an overlong trip to London but I&#8217;ve finally got a spare moment <em>and</em> internet access. All back to normal hopefully soon. (mmmm)</p>
 <p>Anyway&#8230; <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a>! It was ages ago, then some magical time warp type thing happened and it&#8217;s June all of a sudden. And I cant wait. Which is fairly handy as I&#8217;ll shortly be heading out to the pre show party to meet at least some people I know (or at least vaguely recognise from somewhere, once, maybe) and hopefully some new faces, always a solid part of the conferences I think.</p>
 <p>Some of the things I want to do over the next couple of days, besides listen to alot of good stuff. (Rereading this I realised I just refered to Molly, Tantek,  Jeffrey, Eric and everyone as <em>good stuff</em>. This is likely to be something of an understatement. No offence intended!)</p>
<ul>
 <li>Take photos</li>
  <li>More SubEthaEdit note taking</li>
  <li>Eat food (You know who I&#8217;m <a href="http://cackhanded.net">talking</a> <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">about</a>)</li>
  <li>Keep updating the syndicator thing</li>
  <li>Watch the football (sorry, it is the World Cup)</li>
</ul>
 <p>And I&#8217;ve no idea which sessions I&#8217;m going along to before you ask. I&#8217;m still pretending I can go to all of them to avoid the disapointment.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been doing all sorts of stuff I want to blog about; I&#8217;m doing a Masters type usability and testing certificate, playing with more <span class="caps">PEAR</span>, I&#8217;ve been having a play with <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Codeigniter</a> quite a bit as well, which is lovely (thanks <a href="http://thewatchmakerproject.com">Matt</a>) and have a couple more small apps in the oven. I also want to clean up a couple of olders ones (the mailing list, the feed syndicator, etc.) and still need to get round to writing a proper article. And that&#8217;s before @media, I dont want to thing how busy I&#8217;ll make myself after than once I get even more ideas.</p>
 <p>Oh, and apologies for the <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/ical-schedule-for-media#comment">delay</a> in getting <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rp1ahkacn9nkhuqnjtihno34mg@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">the calendar</a> updated. And I&#8217;ve no idea why some people couldn&#8217;t find it with the search tool. Anyway, updated now, so at least people shouldn&#8217;t get lost tomorrow.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to bare with me at the moment. I&#8217;m busy, moving house, have no internet outside work (except open wi-fi points) and oh, did I mention I&#8217;m busy?</p>
 <p>I have the usual raft of ideas, inability to really finish things unless I try and a dangerous penchant for playing with ever more scripting languages (<a href="http://media.wu-wien.ac.at/">XOTcl</a> anyone?).</p>
 <p>Oh, the friends bit? Inspired by <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> and her incredible ability to be open about her life, I thought I&#8217;d say a huge <strong>Thank you</strong> to everyone who helped me move house this week. Much appreciated. It could have gone oh so wrong, but everyone chipping in meant everything worked out just fine.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I dont often just post links to things I find interesting. I try and warble on more about something or other that&#8217;s on my mind. However, being rather busy and coming across something that really stood out makes this here post different.</p>
 <p>I stumbled upon <a href="dabbledb.com">DabbleDB</a> the other day. Watched the <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/utr/">video</a>. Thought to my self &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty darn slick&#8221;.</p>
 <p>DabbleDB is, pretty simply, an online database. For everyone. Ever. The blurb from the site says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dabble DB combines the best of group spreadsheets, custom databases, and intranet web applications into a new way to manage and share your information on the web</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>What does that mean? It&#8217;s basically MS Access, but better and available through a web browser. Too complicated you say? Too hard to grasp? Watch the video. Be impressed.</p>
 <p>One claim I&#8217;m interested in getting first hand experience of is the one regarding Spreadsheets. Most people use spreadsheets as light weight (ie. flimsy) databases, rather than the number crunching powerhouses they really are. DabbleDB seems an ideal replacement to the former, but what about the latter? I remeber seeing <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/">Dean Edwards&#8217;</a> playing with a <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/base/spreadsheet/">Javascript Spreadsheet</a> a while back.</p>
 <p>I have to say I haven&#8217;t used DabbleDB yet. I haven&#8217;t signed up for a one month trial because I know I wouldn&#8217;t have time to explore properly just now. Everything that I&#8217;m excited about comes from the video, the site and the attached blog. When (not if) I get round to having a proper look I&#8217;ll try and remeber to post something.</p>
 <p>Pretty much all your common desktop apps are <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">now</a> <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">available</a> <a href="http://www.writely.com">through</a> <a href="http://calendar.google.com">a</a> <a href="http://gmail.com">browser</a>, except crazy things like image editing. Oh and the browser itself. Now their&#8217;s an idea. A meta browser. Within your browser window open up several smaller windows, maybe using different rendering engines or setups running remotely?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tis about time for another meet up in sunny Newcastle. Pretty short notice but hey, the mailing list has called.</p>
 <p><strong>Thursday 25th of May</strong> it is</p>
 <p>We are aiming for <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=Pubs+in+NE1&#38;om=1&#38;latlng=54972784,-1612320,18338178544157676465">Tilly&#8217;s on Westgate road</a>. More info over on <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/78803/">Upcoming.org</a></p>
 <p>Already a good few people coming along so, if your in the general area, why not join us? If last time is anything to go by expect lots of people who either dont know each other or only know people by domain name discussing anything vaguely (and I do mean vaguely) related to the web.</p>
 <p>The way of recognising everyone, as always, is the carrying of a recognisable web related book. Extra points for something really geeky, or really large.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m hoping for some good banter and some ideas for the future. Hey maybe even making these a regular shindig? It would save us taking ages to decide when and where to meet. Though on the where bit I pretty impressed. Their seems to be a strong correlation between web people in Newcastle and proper beer. Speaking of beer, I heard a rumour that <a href="http://swoo.co.uk">Steve</a> was buying a round to celebrate his new design.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work we mainly use Microsoft technologies, .<span class="caps">NET</span> and such like, for our development. As I mentioned previously I&#8217;m playing with <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> at the moment, and getting on quite nicely. With .<span class="caps">NET</span> being a framework, aimed at allowing a variety of different languages to access the same class library, I though</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I wonder if you can use Python with the .<span class="caps">NET</span> framework?</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>The rather large <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000855/202-7885728-2282211">Programming Python</a> tome alludes to it being on the cards after the implementation of <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> but no more details than that.</p>
 <p>I came across a few dated references indicating that it was possible but, and mentioning very slow reference implementations, all of which didn&#8217;t bode too well. Then up popped <a href="http://ironpython.com/">IronPython</a> from an <a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/9/">article</a> by <a href="http://hugunin.net/">Jim Hugunin</a>. This looked like what I was looking for. But it looked unmaintained, the page not having been updated for a couple of years!</p>
 <p>But the story continued. Jim, having moved to Microsoft, was still working on IronPython and it looks like it&#8217;s moving forwards apace. The latest beta was released on the 20th of April and it looks like 4 more betas before a 1.0 release.</p>
 <p>This discovery makes Python appear even more interesting. A nicely designed, cross platform scripting language with full access to the might of the .<span class="caps">NET</span> framework and it&#8217;s own good looking web development framework in <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>.</p>
 <p>So, for anyone else looking around for similar details here&#8217;s a brief list of up to date information:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Video of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20051110PythonJH/manifest.xml">Jim showing IronPython off</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/IronPython">Python Wiki page about IronPython</a></li>
  <li>Good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPython">WikiPedia entry</a> </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=ad7acff7-ab1e-4bcb-99c0-57ac5a3a9742">official workspace</a></li>
