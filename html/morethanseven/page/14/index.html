  <div class="entry-content"><p>The previous <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/02/11/django-settings-tip-setting-relative-paths/">Django settings tip</a> seemed to go down well so I thought I&#8217;d jot down a few more over the next few weeks. Most of these have come out of working with a decent sized Django team at <a href="http://thisisglobal.com">Global</a> so I can&#8217;t take credit for anything but writing them down for the most part. For this example I think <a href="http://alixandalex.com/obfuscated-signatures/">Alex Knowles</a> did the original version.</p>
<p>I was talking with out friendly <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~rclamp/">sys</a> <a href="http://www.unixdaemon.net/">admins</a> on Friday about a new application and whether they were happy with some application specific logging (using the Python logging module) I&#8217;d build in. Nothing fancy, just application logging to a rotated log file for system events. Their answer was yes, as long as they could control where the log files ended up and the maximum file size, ideally without having to play around in the code or to redeploy the application if they wanted to move the files elsewhere.</p>
<p>These things were already specified in the settings file rather than hardcode into the application but that only gets us half way. The standard Linux way of setting this sort of thing is with a configuration file stored in the /etc directory. So we ended up with the following snippet of code in our settings.py file.</p>
<pre># we're going to allow overriding of settings via a yml file.
# This makes live nicer for anyone managing the box
# and means settings can be overloaded without redeploying the site
SETTINGS_OVERIDE = "/etc/application_name.yml"
try:
    file = open(SETTINGS_OVERIDE)
    for key, value in yaml.load(file).items():
        globals()[key]=value
except:
    # we don't always have the file around or need the setting 
    # defined so best to be quite if things go wrong
    pass</pre>
<p>Then in the yaml file you can simply clobber any of the settings using a simple name value pair approach.</p>
<pre>LOG_FILE: "/var/log/application_name.log"</pre>
<p>It lets us keep production paths that might change out of the developers code, at the same time as giving the sys admins a familiar way of managing the production environment.</p>
<p>It does have one downside, if you&#8217;re not aware of it&#8217;s presence then it can make debugging settings related issues a pain. With that in mind you could wrap it so as to only work this way when <span class="caps">DEBUG</span> is False, or take the approach here which is to leave extensive comments.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Django settings files are pretty interesting. Rather than being written in some sort of purely declarative markup they just use Python. This brings both lots of power as well as the ability to do things in the settings file that you probably shouldn&#8217;t do.</p>
<p>One area where I find this capability particularly useful is when specifying file system paths. Lots of the settings concern where Django can find templates, images, or stylesheets for instance. The examples given in the default settings file are all of the form <em>/this/directory/structure/</em>. If you plan on only working on your own, and never running your applications anywhere except your local machine this is probably fine. The moment you want to deploy your application, or want to collaborate with others this becomes a problem. You either have to agree upon a fixed directory structure between all developers (annoying) or have distinct settings files for each machine, which probably means them being outside source control (also annoying).</p>
<p>A better approach is to have those paths dynamically ascertained at runtime. It makes the application much more portable, making local development and production use easier. Using the standard library <em>os</em> module we can do just that.</p>
<pre>import os
import django
# calculated paths for django and the site
# used as starting points for various other paths
DJANGO_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(django.__file__))
SITE_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))</pre>
<p>Here we set a couple of useful constants, one is the path to the site folder and the other the path to where django is stored on this machine. settings.py contains a number of places where these constants are useful. For instance the MEDIA_ROOT settings which specifies the file system location for assets like images or stylesheets. The default settings file even comes with an instruction and example showing a non portable path.</p>
<pre># Absolute path to the directory that holds media.
# Example: "/home/media/media.lawrence.com/"
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'assets')</pre>
<p>Other examples include setting the path for a SQLite database:</p>
<pre>DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
DATABASE_NAME = os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'db') + '/development.db'</pre>
<p>Or specifying directories in which we can place templates.</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'templates')
)</pre>
<p>I actually think this should probably make it&#8217;s way into the default settings file. I might very well be missing something but I can&#8217;t see when it&#8217;s not much better to do things this way.</p></div>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quick Django pop quiz. Can anyone spot the deliberate mistake in the following url definition? We&#8217;re trying to define a view called log_viewer and instructing a specific url pattern to render it.</p>
<pre>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^log/?$', log_viewer),
)</pre>
<p>In this case our regex matches /log or /log/ using the /? optional pattern. This is because even if we only link to one format we know people will probably visit both, either by entering the <span class="caps">URL</span> manually or by linking from an external source.</p>
<p>As far as <span class="caps">HTTP</span> is concerned though /log and /log/ are separate URLs, even if they display the same content. The main reason this matters for public facing websites is that our friendly search engine spiders are likely to index both separately, leading to splitting the page rank as well as accusations of duplicate content which might see further erosion of rankings.</p>
<p>The solution is generally to issue a 301 redirect from one format to the other. This tells search engines and people alike that the canonical location for the requested content is elsewhere. You could specify the redirect manually, but this is going to get irritating quickly once you have a few more definitions.</p>
<pre>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^log$', redirect_to, {'url': '/log/'}),
    (r'^log/$', log_viewer),
)</pre>
<p>Handily Django provides a mechanism to do exactly what we want to do by setting <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#append-slash">APPEND_SLASH</a> to True in your settings file. Even better it&#8217;s switched on by default. So if you don&#8217;t know much about the intricacies of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> you still get the correct behavior. That is unless you specify your <span class="caps">URL</span> patterns in the format above.</p>
<p>You see APPEND_SLASH only works if the <span class="caps">URL</span> doesn&#8217;t match a specified pattern. If no pattern match is found it appends a trailing slash and checks for a match again. Because the above pattern matches the pattern without the trailing slash (/log) the desired behavior is never triggered, and the view is rendered at both URLs. So although we want to catch /log and /log/ on the front end, our urls.py definition should actually be:</p>
<pre>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^log/$', log_viewer),
)</pre>
<p>Django has lots of useful bits of magic for doing the right thing, but unless you know what they <em>actually</em> do you either end up recreating functionality yourself, or find features don&#8217;t work in quite the way you thought. It&#8217;s a good argument for keeping frameworks small whenever possible, and for developers to at least know their way around the code of their respective framework.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three weeks ago I pondered whether <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/01/15/are-xmpp-and-offline-processing-coming-google-app-/"><span class="caps">XMPP</span> and offline processing were coming to Google App Engine?</a>. It was a hunch based on the upcoming release of Jaiku on App Engine. I reasoned you couldn&#8217;t really do it without <span class="caps">XMPP</span> and offline processing APIs. Looks like I was right.</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/">Joe Gregorio</a> announced on the <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/">App Engine Blog</a> an <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/02/roadmap-update.html">update to the roadmap for the next 6 months</a>; including</p>
<ul>
	<li>Support for running scheduled tasks</li>
	<li>Task queues for performing background processing</li>
	<li>Ability to receive and process incoming email</li>
	<li>Support for sending and receiving <span class="caps">XMPP</span> (Jabber) messages</li>
</ul>
<p>Colour me excited. This could be the point were we start seeing more and more interesting IM interfaces. And this ticks off several of my must haves for App Engine.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like adding images to the occasional blog post but don&#8217;t do it as often as I want to. The reason being I can hardly ever be bothered to resize images. It means opening up a memory hogging application, fiddling around for a few minutes and then saving it out somewhere, then uploading said image to my server. All of those things bore me.</p>
<p>Appengine to the rescue. As an excuse to play around with the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/images/overview.html">image <span class="caps">API</span></a> as well as add more pictures to this here blog I decided to build myself a small image hosting application. I really only care about the two things noted above; resizing and uploading. If I can do that in one go I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p>A couple of train rides (all the best code gets written on train journeys, fact) later and I&#8217;ve deployed the first version of Image Host which looks a little something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjtBww" alt="Image Hosting interface on Google App Engine"/></p>
<p>(And yes that image is an image of image-host hosted on image-host. If you&#8217;re thinking <em>what image?</em> then it means this experiment isn&#8217;t working at the moment.)</p>
<p>The application is designed in such a way as you could have as many people uploading and managing their own set of images as you want, all within one instance. The only reason I don&#8217;t just open it up to any google user account is that it would eat into my quotas if it got popular and I have no interest in policing whatever dubious images anyone might upload.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with App Engine quite extensively of late. I really appreciate the <span class="caps">SDK</span> and the limited, but well designed and thought out APIs and testing stubs. At the moment I&#8217;m happy with where it&#8217;s at. It&#8217;s obviously early days but in my mind all I really want are APIs for offline processing, some sort of message queuing facility, <span class="caps">XMPP</span> support and a payment model for raising the limitations. And several of those are already slated for the near future.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to host their own version you can grab the code from <a href="http://github.com/garethr/appengine-image-host/tree/master">GtHub</a>. You&#8217;ll need your own App Engine account and your own snappy name but that&#8217;s all. If you really don&#8217;t want to do that, have a good reason to needing image hosting and ask nicely I might add more people to my version as well.</p>
<p>Their are a few bugs I&#8217;m going to fix when I get a moment,  a few documented limitations I know about and I&#8217;m still fleshing out the test suite to cover all the functionality. But all in all a worthwhile few hours spent hacking. I&#8217;ll probably get round to writing up some pointers for testing App Engine code as well as their are a host of gotchas and the only real documentation at present is comments in the code.</p></div>

It&#8217;s a worthwhile read for anyone involved in this sort of decision in any capacity.

Lots of conversations keep cropping up on Twitter about why bother switching to Git or other distributed systems &#8211; this is a good place to start whether you use Python or not.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinarta</a> Ruby web development framework recently and building a <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">larger than usual Hello World Example</a>. It&#8217;s describes itself as <em>a <span class="caps">DSL</span> for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby with minimal effort</em> (what is it about Ruby people and their obsession with calling everything a <span class="caps">DSL</span>?). In reality it&#8217;s a great little web framework. It deals with a minimal set of the things you really need to do as part of any application &#8211; <span class="caps">URL</span> handling and routing, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request and response handling, etc. It reminds me of <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> in it&#8217;s minimalist approach which is definitely a good thing.</p>
<p>The following example is the hello world given on the site</p>
<pre>require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
get '/' do
  'Hello world!'
end</pre>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t a million miles away from a web.py example:</p>
<pre>import web
urls = (
    '/', 'hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())
class hello:        
    def GET(self, name):
        return 'Hello World'
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()</pre>
<p>The only real difference is the separate mapping of URLs to views in web.py, which is closer to how Rails or Django do things.</p>
<p>Their is quite a bit of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/documentation.html">documentation</a> already for Sinatra, including the start of a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html">book</a>. The code (as with all good code these days) is on <a href="http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/tree/master">github</a> for your forking pleasure.</p>
<p>As for what I&#8217;ve been up to I have a more advanced <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">Hello World</a> example up on GitHub. I&#8217;m wanting to get a running application that demonstrates all the basic features (except <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2008/04/11/dsls-for-html-and-css-the-future-or-just-plain-wro/"><span class="caps">HAML</span> and <span class="caps">SASS</span></a> support). So far I&#8217;ve got a simple bit of Rack middleware, several views demonstrating different url handling techniques, basic erb templates, before methods, configuration settings, error handling, decent unit test coverage, a rake file with a tasks for documentation, code coverage, etc. I&#8217;ve also got configuration files for running the application with <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> and using <a href="http://god.rubyforge.org/">God</a>. I&#8217;m going to add some simple database connectivity in at some point (either <a href="http://datamapper.org">DataMapper</a> or <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, I haven&#8217;t decided yet) and play around with writing spec tests and a capistrano recipe file. All in it&#8217;s a nice way of learning something new at the same time as producing something that might be useful. Once I have the rest of the bits and pieces I might even right a full tutorial.</p>
<p>I think the sweet spot for these sorts of mini frameworks are small services or little applications that just sit their are run. Both <a href="http://integrityapp.com/">Integrity</a> and <a href="http://irclogger.com">IRCLogger</a> both use Sinatra for instance and I think it&#8217;s used for the <a href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">GitHub WebHooks</a> as well. It&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing Google AppEngine is useful for in fact and Sinatra would likely be a closer fit that Rails if Google ever feel like adding Ruby support. Although it does depress me a little that the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list">top four items in the public issue tracker</a> are <em>I want my own language</em>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsonpickle">Jsonpickle</a> is a Python library for serializing any arbitrary object graph into <span class="caps">JSON</span>. The advantage over something like simplejson is the <em>arbitrary</em> part, simplejson throws errors when you try and serialize some types of objects. I also prefer the jsonpickle <span class="caps">API</span> (encode, decode) over simplejson (dump, dumps, load, loads).</p></div>
