  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it was the <a href="http://www.bamboojuice.co.uk/">Bamboo Juice</a> conference last Friday at the rather impressive Eden project in Cornwall. Along with <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://www.thehodge.co.uk/">Dom</a>, <a href="http://boagworld.com/">Paul</a> and <a href="http://www.scatteredpoppies.com/">Relly</a> I presented to the crowd of mainly local first time web conference goers.</p>
<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=selfeducationforwebprofessionals-090427034436-phpapp02&stripped_title=self-education-for-web-professionals" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=selfeducationforwebprofessionals-090427034436-phpapp02&stripped_title=self-education-for-web-professionals" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>It was a great event, and felt a lot like the first Highland Fling in that it was the first big event in an area that&#8217;s actually quite a distance from the bright lights of London (it took 8 hours to get back to Cambridge). The party afterwards, held in one of the biomes at the Eden project itself, was also pretty impressive.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully right up some of my notes from the presentation soon, but for the moment I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/self-education-for-web-professionals">uploaded the slides to Slideshare</a>. The whole thing was video&#8217;d as well so look out for those in the future.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another project I hacked together on the train running on App Engine I&#8217;m afraid. Anyone getting bored of my <em>new project each week</em> posts please stop reading now.</p>
<p><a href="http://gitbug.appspot.com"><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjZNgw" alt="GitBug interface"/></a></p>
<p>Issue or bug tracking is just one of those things we all deal with and probably have opinions on. Lots of open source software exists (<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">BugZilla</a>, <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>) to do the job and various companies have commercial products (<a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a>, <a href="http://sifterapp.com/">Sifter</a>, <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/products/fixx/">Fixx</a>). So why did I go and create another one?</p>
<p>Certainly not because I think I can do a better job for the majority. This is very much a personal pet project and I don&#8217;t very much fancy competing with teams of smart people building good products.</p>
<p>Like most software projects my issue tracker was designed to scratch a personal itch. I now have 28 repos over on <a href="http://github.com/garethr">GitHub</a> (how did that happen?). Some of these are public projects I&#8217;d like other peoples input on, and for me that means having a public list of issues. But these aren&#8217;t active projects being worked on by a team of people &#8211; it&#8217;s mainly just me (with Brad and Simon occasionally correcting my spelling and grammar) hacking on the train to work and back. I don&#8217;t need collaboration features. I don&#8217;t want to be limited to a small number of projects. I&#8217;d rather not pay lots of money, or worry too much about hosting.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s where <a href="http://gitbug.appspot.com">GitBug</a> comes in. Bug tracking for people with minimal needs.</p>
<p>The only real <em>feature</em> past a very minimal bug tracker is the ability to close bugs via a GitHub webhook. Oh and lots of <span class="caps">JSON</span> and <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds for everything but that&#8217;s just the way we should build things now anyway.</p>
<p>Their are areas of the interface that could do with some streamlining and a couple of open bugs that don&#8217;t yet cause me enough pain to fix. I have however opened it up for anyone with a Google account to use and a few people have started adding their own projects and issues already. I&#8217;m hoping that for the most part by keeping it as simple as possible I can avoid having to do any work on <em>it</em> and work on bugs in other projects instead, of which I&#8217;m sure there are many.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There has been <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1566/">lots of talk</a> recently about <span class="caps">URL</span> shortening. Services like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> have been around for a good while, offering shortened versions of URLs like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/dd7w2m">tinyurl.com/dd7w2m</a> which are easier to put in a tweet or an email. The problem with this is that not only does the shorter version mask any information about the destination, but if TinyURL or one of the other shortening services goes away, or loses control of it&#8217;s domain name, a large number of links are going to stop working the way they should.</p>
<p><a href="http://laughingmeme.org/">Kellan</a> in particular has been proposing some simple steps that might get us out of this hole. You can read more about the ideas behind using <a href="http://revcanonical.wordpress.com/">Rev=Canonical</a> and try out the future (maybe) of these services at <a href="http://revcanonical.appspot.com">revcanonical.appspot.com</a>.</p>
<p>The nicest thing from my point of view about this idea is how simple it is to implement. This blog is running a custom Django based blogging engine called <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-train/tree/master">Train</a>.</p>
<p>The posts on this site exist at urls like the following: <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/04/04/mixing-it-programming-language-choice/">morethanseven.net/2009/04/04/mixing-it-programming-language-choice/</a>. With only a small view function, a change to a template and the addition of a url this blog should now work with Kellans new url shortener.</p>
<p>I decided to use the ids for the articles on the blog as the key for the short versions. So if you were to visit <a href="http://morethanseven.net/284">morethanseven.net/284</a> you would get the article above. I decided to issue a redirect from the short version to the long version in the end rather than serve duplicate content with the canonical link, not sure which way is probably best though.</p>
<p>The markup for each article contains the required link in the head of the document:</p>
<pre>&lt;link rel="alternate shorter" href="http://morethanseven.net/284"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>And the django view looks something like this:</p>
<pre>def tiny(request, id):
    "Provide tiny urls based on ids for articles"
    # get the article or throw a 404
    article = get_object_or_404(Article, id=id, status='live')
    url = article.get_absolute_url()
    # redirect to the relevant
    return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(url)</pre>
<p>All in all, incredible simply to implement, especially in something like Rails or Django which make this sort of wire up urls to view stuff easy. So what&#8217;s stopping you adding this to you site or current project? If enough people just do it we can make the web a slightly better place in reasonably short order.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/01/twitter_on_scala/">Register article about Twitter</a> seems to have kicked over yet another Ruby/Rails doesn&#8217;t scale debate &#8211; mainly it seems from people who haven&#8217;t read any of the back story or the real meat of the story. For anyone catching up I&#8217;d suggest reading <a href="http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html">this recent interview</a> with three of the Twitter developers. Ikai Lan made some particular good points about <a href="http://ikaisays.com/2009/04/02/twitter-ruby-on-rails-scala-and-people-who-dont-rtfa/">people who don&#8217;t <span class="caps">RTFM</span></a> and the comments are well worth reading too. Tony Arcieri, of <a href="http://wiki.reia-lang.org/">Reia</a> fame, took another approach and wondered why <a href="http://unlimitednovelty.com/2009/04/twitter-blaming-ruby-for-their-mistakes.html">non of the open source message queues every got a look in</a></p>
<p>What it really all comes down to is that Twitter are using more than one language to write their systems in. What I don&#8217;t understand is why this is a shock to anyone, or why it&#8217;s a bad think? Google appear to use Java and Python for most things. Yahoo! use Java and <span class="caps">PHP</span> (and C and Perl I think?). Microsoft use VB and C/C++/C# and probably F#. At work we use .<span class="caps">NET</span> and Python for different things.</p>
<p>Big companies have been using multiple languages and platforms for good and bad reasons for ever. Sometimes it&#8217;s about legacy systems, but often it&#8217;s about using the right tool for the job. I think lots of people jumping in on the debate do so from a point of view that everyone uses one language for everything, mainly because most personal projects or small agency style jobs do just that. Why overcomplicate smaller projects with the need for people to know more than one language? In a small general purpose team it&#8217;s also going to make recruiting and getting people up to speed much harder.</p>
<p>But for startups doing interesting things it&#8217;s potentially both more efficient and more interesting to use multiple platforms. I think Dopplr might be mainly Ruby with a smattering of Erlang, all built around an ApacheMQ message queue, and <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/">Matt</a> has talked about that architecture at various conferences without being called out on it.</p>
<p>So for your next personal project why not pick a handy message queue (personally I like <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> and <a href="http://stompserver.rubyforge.org/">StompServer</a>), and at least two complimentary languages and see how it changes the architecture of what you build? Mix <span class="caps">PHP</span> with an Erlang backend or go for Twitters Ruby/Scala mix. It might very well be overkill for that blog or todo list application you had in mind, but it just might  teach you more about picking the right tools for the job when you come across non-trivial problems.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looks like I&#8217;m being experimented on. I just got a strange <em>Web</em> button appearing on a search today and decided to click it. It revealed a host of new Google features (at least I&#8217;ve never seen em before), including various filters and visualisation tools.</p>
<p>The entertainingly named Wonder Wheel was my first click. It&#8217;s a visualisation which shows related search terms. I&#8217;d love to have access to that data via an <span class="caps">API</span> as well.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRiJJww" alt="Example of Wonder Wheel search on Google"/></p>
<p>The timeline view, and time based filters, look more useful for most search activities. Just getting hold of recent content on a particular search term is the sort of thing blog search engines have sended to do well in the past and that Twitter search has been showing off.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRiiHww" /></p>
<p>I hope I keep these features during whatever testing is going on and that they all go live soon. It&#8217;s a pretty big improvement if you ask me.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing again with App Engine, and going back to an on/off pet project that I&#8217;ve build variations of for a while.</p>
<p><a href="http://hackerposts.appspot.com"><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRihHww" alt="Hacker Posts"/></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s basically a pretty straightforward aggregation platform, taking content from a number of feeds and creating relationships between the items. It&#8217;s mainly an experiment in creating a decent size site on App Engine &#8211; it can be surprising how many urls you can get out of a good corpus of data:</p>
<ul>
	<li>400 items, each with a unique url</li>
	<li>each item has a variable number of tags generated, at the moment that amounts to about 1000 unique urls</li>
	<li>each month and year of content gets a url so that&#8217;s another 4 or so</li>
	<li>each day for which we have items we also get a url, so that&#8217;s another 90 or so</li>
</ul>
<p>So starting off with 1500 or so pages isn&#8217;t bad. The site also grows over time as new items are posted or I add more feeds. Everything else I&#8217;ve done with App Engine has been more <a href="http://imified-demo.appspot.com/">application</a> <a href="http://image-host.appspot.com/">focused</a> so seeing how a content site performs is interesting in and of itself.</p>
<p>The data in question I used for this first experiment was the feeds I could find from the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/leaders">top posters on Hacker News</a>. Hence the name <a href="http://hackerposts.appspot.com">Hacker Posts</a>. That left me with 35 feeds:</p>

<p>I have a couple of other communities or events that I&#8217;d like to do the same thing around, as well as a few features I want to add to the underlying software. The nice thing with App Engine is rolling new instances out is as simple as running a command.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The webapp framework wish ships with App Engine uses the Django templating system by default, but without Django apps doesn&#8217;t support the same mechanism for loading template tags and filters. <a href="http://javawonders.blogspot.com/2009/01/google-app-engine-templates-and-custom.html">This is how to do it though</a> using a few webapp.template methods.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">WSGI</span> is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification for web servers and application servers to communicate with web applications (though it can also be used for more than that). It is a Python standard, described in detail in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/"><span class="caps">PEP</span> 333</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Ruby people <span class="caps">WSGI</span> is the <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a> in Python. In fact it was one of the inspirations behind Rack. Rack descriptions itself as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rack provides an minimal interface between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I think is a clearer explanation, except in WSGI&#8217;s case we replace Ruby with Python.</p>
<p>As well as being able to write <span class="caps">WSGI</span> middleware for Django or Pylons we can also write <span class="caps">WSGI</span> middleware for App Engine applications &#8211; which is what I spent some time doing today. For the most part I found the examples and documentation interesting but overkill for what I needed to do. Specifically I wanted a piece of middleware which modified the response content, adding extra content into the response. Most of the examples I found didn&#8217;t focus on middleware, or where full blown examples making them hard to follow.</p>
<p>So for anyone looking for a simple example of <span class="caps">WSGI</span> middleware which adds content into the response here goes. I used the <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/webob/">WebOb</a> framework because it provides a nicer interface to the request and response objects and it&#8217;s included in the standard App Engine <span class="caps">SDK</span>. The following sample middleware simple adds <em>Hello World</em> to the end of every response.</p>
<pre>from webob import Request
class SimpleMiddleware(object):
    "Example middleware that appends a message to all 200 html responses"    
    def __init__(self, app):
        self.app = app
    def __call__(self, environ, start_response):       
        # deal with webob request and response objects
        # due to a nicer interface
        req = Request(environ)
        resp = req.get_response(self.app)
        # add a string to the end of the body
        body = resp.body + "Hello World"
        # set the body to the new copy
        resp.body = body
        return resp(environ, start_response)</pre>
<p>In reality you might want to append something to a specific place in the response, or introduce conditionals. This is easy enough to do by parsing the initial value of <em>resp.body</em> in the example above.</p>
<p>To use the middleware in your application you simple wrap your current WSGIApplication instance with the middleware class.</p>
<pre>application = webapp.WSGIApplication(ROUTES, debug=settings.DEBUG)
# add simple middleware
application = SimpleMiddleware(application)
run_wsgi_app(application)</pre>
<p><span class="caps">WSGI</span> middleware is both a useful place for common functionality to live in your App Engine application as well as being a handy tool for anyone working across multiple Python frameworks to share code.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine">JauikuEngine</a>, the open source, App Engine based, version of Jaiku is now available for everyone to look at. I <a href="http://twitter.com/garethr/status/1321372099">found the repo a couple of days ago</a> but it was restricted to project members. The main reason I want to hunt through the code is to have a look at what I&#8217;m guessing will be API&#8217;s available in a soon to be released version of App Engine &#8211; with specific interest in anything to do with <span class="caps">XMPP</span>, queues and offline processing.</p>
<p>Well it looks like I&#8217;m out of luck for the moment at least. In the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/source/browse/trunk/settings.py">settings file</a> I found the following two snippets though:</p>
<pre>#
# XMPP / IM
#
# Enabling IM will require a bit more than just making this True, please
# read the docs at http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/wiki/im_support
IM_ENABLED = False
# This is the id (JID) of the IM bot that you will use to communicate with
# users of the IM interface
IM_BOT = 'root@example.com'
# Turn on test mode for IM
IM_TEST_ONLY = False
# JIDs to allow when testing live XMPP so you don't spam all your users
IM_TEST_JIDS = []</pre>
<p>And another for queues:</p>
<pre>#
# Task Queue
#
# Enabling the queue will allow you to process posts with larger numbers
# of followers but will require you to set up a cron job that will continuously
# ping a special url to make sure the queue gets processed
QUEUE_ENABLED = True
# The secret to use for your cron job that processes your queue
QUEUE_VENDOR_SECRET = 'SECRET'</pre>
<p>The only problem appears to be that the page referenced, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/wiki/im_support">code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/wiki/im_support</a>, currently says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><acronym title="termie"><span class="caps">TODO</span></acronym>: describe how to get IM working with Jaiku Engine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <a href="http://twitter.com/termie">termie</a>, or anyone else on the inside, I&#8217;d love to know how to get this up and running?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be having a better look through the code when I get a chance. This was just the first thing I jumped on before heading out the door. I love Open Source.</p></div>
