  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been noticing an interesting trend recently, not one I have any empirical evidence for mind, but one I though interesting non-the-less. Parts of the webstandards world appear to all be playing with <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>. Part of this has been the odd mention down the pub, at barcamps or at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> this year. But the main source of information on the topic has been <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. To name but a few I&#8217;ve seen tweets from <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve</a>, <a href="http://thecssdiv.co.uk">Ross</a> and <a href="http://aralbalkan.com">Aral</a> recently and <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">Stuart</a> and <a href="http://cyril.doussin.name/thoughts/">Cyril</a> literally wont shut up about it.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that this didn&#8217;t happen with Rails, not in the corner of the pub that generally talks more about markup, javascript and <span class="caps">CSS</span> anyway. I&#8217;ve worked on a couple of Rails projects both personally and commercially, and I&#8217;ve just launched a little pet project build with django called <a href="http://doesyourapi.com">doesyourapi</a>. What follows is, to my mind, a few reasons why I think this trend exists and also why I think it will continue, at least for the time being.</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t ignore the personal touch, and in <a href="http://simonwillison.com">Simon Willison</a> and <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/">Stuart Langridge</a> we already have two people who bridge the Python/Django community and the web standards crowd, at least in the UK. Personal technology choices at least are often driven by personal correspondence.</p>
<h3>Templating</h3>
<p>Django&#8217;s templating introduces a very simple syntax <em>and nothing else</em>. Rails lets you have the full power of Ruby to do with as you will within your views. Rails also makes heavy use of helpers, further adding to the complexity of views. Now I have mixed views here, based on my own skills more than anything. I know I&#8217;d feel much more comfortable throwing someone with good markup skills at a project using Django than Rails. For the most part with Django you use the html you&#8217;re used to, Rails often wants you to change this to helpers &#8211; in much the same way as <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> does in fact. I think some of this comes from the Rails <em>don&#8217;t repeat yourself</em> <del>philosophy</del> <ins>obsession</ins>. Sometimes this leads to programmatic complexity which makes working with templates more akin to programming, even if it means less duplication. I&#8217;ve yet to work on a particularly complex Django project so maybe this simplicity might become a limitation to work around? Always a possibility.</p>
<h3>Default craziness</h3>
<p>Some of the bits and pieces that come bundled with Rails are just plain wrong, the Javascript helpers being one example. The abuse of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> by default in some of the scaffolding code being another. Oh, and the markup coming out of various helpers as well. In trying to help the application developer Rails gets in the way of the professional webstandards types. Django does next to none of this for you. Programmers coming from Rails might see this as missing features. Frontend types prefer this clean slate approach because it means you don&#8217;t have to fight the backend (sometimes including people) for control of the output. Note that you can work around much of this (in the same way as you can work <em>around</em> <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> if you have to), it&#8217;s just nicer to not have to.</p>
<h3>Other craziness</h3>
<p>Rails people love Ruby. After all it&#8217;s better than Java (it&#8217;s also a pretty loveable programming language too). But like computer science departments everywhere many Rails people also dislike or simply put up with <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript. If they can find a way of not having to write these and write something else (Rails people are also obsessed with domain specific languages) instead. Hence we have the likes of <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/"><span class="caps">HAML</span></a> and <a href="http://lab.hamptoncatlin.com/play/with/sass"><span class="caps">SASS</span></a>. The problem is that us frontend loving folk quite like writing <span class="caps">CSS</span> (well, sometimes) and absolutely love writing <span class="caps">HTML</span>. Most of the time for good reasons too &#8211; just look at microformats for an example. Frontend developers tend to like using a mix of tools, predominantly backend developers not so much it seems.</p>
<p>Personally I find it interesting. You could quite easily flip many of these arguments around to support why so many people are using Rails. For two frameworks with similar goals and uses it&#8217;s interesting to see the early philosophical differences playing out in the real world. It might be interesting to see what happens with frameworks like <a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a> as well which seems to be set out to avoid many of these perceived issues with Rails. So, have anyone else noticed anything similar? Or even the complete opposite?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>BarCampNorthEast is go. <a href="http://www.codeworks.net">A</a> <a href="http://blog.meriwilliams.com/">few</a> &#8220;people&#8221;:&quot;http://www.agm.me.uk/blog/ have finally got together and sorted out the long promised barcamp in Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to be holding the event in the middle of Newcastle, at <a href="http://theartworksgalleries.com/">The Art Works</a> on the weekend of the 24th/25th of May. That&#8217;s a whole two months away, ample time for everyone to make arrangements hopefully. From the early discussions we were always set upon going the whole hog and having a two day event. The venue is big enough for people to sleep over as well if they want which is great. It keeps the cost down for anyone visiting as well as meaning we can play Werewolf all night. We&#8217;re piggy backing on the <a href="http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital conference</a> as well so hopefully some of the people from that will stick around for the barcamp.</p>
<p>We have the requisite <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampNorthEast">Barcamp wiki</a> page as well as a listing on <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/462291/">Upcoming</a>. Feel free to indicate your interest on either of these. Registration isn&#8217;t open just yet, but we should be opening that up next week on <strong>Tuesday 1st April at 11:00am</strong>. Look for the link on here, on <a href="http://twitter.com/garethr">twitter</a>, on the upcoming and barcamp wiki pages and anywhere else I can think of to shout about it.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me with any questions. If you&#8217;re not sure what all the fuss is about then have a look at the <a href="http://barcamp.org/">barcamp</a> site. And if you&#8217;ve never been outside London before then maybe this is your chance. Newcastle is only two and a half hours away by a train with free wifi. We&#8217;re also on the lookout for a few sponsors; if your interested drop me a line.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://twill.idyll.org/">Twill</a> a little recently. It&#8217;s a Python based <span class="caps">DSL</span> used for functional testing of websites. From the official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twill is a simple language that allows users to browse the Web from a command-line interface. With twill, you can navigate through Web sites that use forms, cookies, and most standard Web features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple example might make things clearer. You&#8217;ll need to install twill first &#8211; the instructions are available on <a href="http://twill.idyll.org/">the site</a>. We can write tests directly into the shell so we&#8217;ll start their. For our first test we&#8217;ll write one that will hopefully fail &#8211; a test to check whether this website is down.</p>
<pre><code>twill-sh
&gt;&gt; go http://morethanseven.net
&gt;&gt; code 404</code></pre>
<p>First we fire up the twill shell then enter two simple commands. The first command, <em>go</em>, sends the browser to the specified <span class="caps">URL</span>. The second command is an assertion, in this case a check on the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status code. If this website is available then it should return the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> code 200, if it&#8217;s unavailable then it will probably return a 404 Not Found. This test will hopefully fail, indicating that this website is up and running. In reality you&#8217;re more likely to test for the 200 status code and fail on anything else but for this example it&#8217;s useful to see what a failing test looks like.</p>
<p>Although pretty powerful the twill scripting language is nice and small. I&#8217;ve listed most of the commands below just to give you an idea of the sort of things that you can get up to. You can type <em>help</em> at the twill shell to get more information on the available commands and the individual commands themselves.</p>
<ul>
	<li>twill-sh</li>
	<li>twill-sh {filename}</li>
	<li>twill-sh {filename1} {filename2}</li>
	<li>twill-sh -u {url} {filename}</li>
	<li>twill-sh -n {filename}</li>
	<li>go {url}</li>
	<li>show</li>
	<li>save_html {file-name}</li>
	<li>showlinks</li>
	<li>showforms</li>
	<li>follow {url|url-name}</li>
	<li>back</li>
	<li>reload</li>
	<li>showhistory</li>
	<li>echo {variable}</li>
	<li>formvalue {form} {input} {value}</li>
	<li>submit {input}</li>
	<li>show_cookies</li>
	<li>save_cookies {file-name}</li>
	<li>load_cookies {file-name}</li>
	<li>clear_cookies</li>
	<li>code {code}</li>
	<li>url {text}</li>
	<li>title {text}</li>
	<li>find {text}</li>
	<li>setglobal {name} {value}</li>
	<li>setlocal {name} {value}</li>
	<li>debug http 1</li>
	<li>redirect_output {file}</li>
	<li>redirect_error {file}</li>
	<li>agent {ie5|ie55|ie6|opera7|konq32|saf11|aol9}</li>
	<li>add_auth {realm} {url} {user} {password}</li>
	<li>runfile {file-name}</li>
	<li>extend_with check_links</li>
	<li>check_links</li>
	<li>check_links {regex}</li>
	<li>twill-fork -n {number} -p {processes} {script}</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also store tests in individual files as well as run a batch of tests at once. I have a couple of tests that I can run against any <span class="caps">URL</span> which might be a useful starting point for anyone else starting to look at testing their sites or applications. You can <a href="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/downloads/twill/twill.zip">download these tests here</a>.</p>
<p>If you unpack the zip archive and then open the folder in a terminal or console. You can then run all of the tests like so, note we&#8217;re passing the starting <span class="caps">URL</span> into the scripts which makes using the same scripts for multiple sites easier.</p>
<pre><code>twill-sh * -u http://morethanseven.net</code></pre>
<p>The tests included do a few things; from checking for the presence of several required markup elements and checking for an <span class="caps">XHTML</span> doctype to checking that all the links on the page are working.</p>
<p>All these examples are pretty simple and non-site-specific. For more complex form based applications you can write application browsers which fill out forms, create user sessions and do everything a user might do. Twill is also particularly useful when it comes to testing RESTful webservices with all the URLs and <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status codes floating about.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/02/urls-are-people-too.html">URLs are people too</a> then you better make sure you control your URLs.</p>
<p>Although some people use blog hosting services like <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> the majority of serious bloggers, web designers or companies generally use their own domain name to host their site. Controlling your own domain name is increasingly important when that <span class="caps">URL</span> is a representation of you on the internet.</p>
<p>With all these social networks we&#8217;re starting to have pieces of us scattered all over the place. I&#8217;ve joked previously about the utility of domain names over real names for interpersonal communication but this breaks down a little when not all the urls that represent me are owned by me. I control morethanseven.net/photos but I only have some influence over <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/garethr">flickr.com/photos/garethr</a>. With external hosts you also need to be aware of cybersquatting. I own morethanseven.net so no one else can use it. However with services that give you your own <span class="caps">URL</span> as part of registration everywhere people can cybersquat in hundreds of new domains that you might not even know about.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just web pages you have to worry about. Feeds are another example of URLs you just might want to keep control over. This last one is also something I see lots of people handing off to others &#8211; specifically <a href="http://feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>. Now I&#8217;m a big fan of feedburner and use it for the feeds on this site. But I don&#8217;t use the feedburner <span class="caps">URL</span>, anyone subscribing to the feeds here does so using morethanseven.net/feed/. If I decide to stop using feedburner I can, without having to upset the few people who subscribe to it by moving my feed address. It&#8217;s the same with email addresses; I love gmail but rarely actually give my gmail email address out.</p>
<p>So, start looking after your domain names a little more carefully. They are pieces of you scattered around the internet, and losing control of them is going to become increasingly socially painful.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, while sat with a few people at the WaSP panel at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> (of which more later when I&#8217;m fully caught up) I got a nice email from the folks at <a href="http://2008.xtech.org">Xtech</a> accepting my presentation idea. The abstract is below. If any of that sounds interesting or up your street I&#8217;d love to hear other peoples experiences or ideas on the subject.</p>
<h2>Design Strategies for a Distributed Web</h2>
<h3>From language frameworks to APIs</h3>
<p>Everyone is making use of mature and stable web application or javascript frameworks these days. That means weâ€™ve stopped reinventing things such as routing and object relational mapping, but weâ€™re all still building very similar components again and again. Frameworks might allow us to solve lots of fine grained problems but APIs could let us solve common course grained problems quicker.</p>
<h3>Building blocks for your applications</h3>
<p>Their are already a few examples in the wild of APIs designed to be used as part of your application development process. Amazon has been leading the way in providing remote services such as S3, EC2 and SimpleDB. Their are also options when it comes to hosting these services yourself, the mint analytics software and the CouchDb database service are both good examples.</p>
<h3>Quality engineering for free</h3>
<p>The real value of outsourcing a discreet portion of your application to a third party <span class="caps">API</span> lies in quality. You could always use local storage and your programming language of choice to deal with a large volume of file read and write operations. But do you really think youâ€™ll beat Amazon for reliability, scalability and speed?</p>
<h3>Functionality vs Data</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s not just high quality functionality that we could leverage from other providers. Weâ€™re all fed up with entering and re-entering our personal data into each new service. With advancements like OAuth and Microformats and lots of focus on data portability at the moment we might just be able to share data too.</p>
<h3>Change the client as well as the server</h3>
<p>Sometimes itâ€™s not enough to just change the server. The rise of specialised browsers such as Joost and Songbird allows for functionality that would be impossible otherwise. Site specific browser, along with advancements such as local storage, may prove<br />
Problems</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not all in place just yet. The reliability of your application is likely to be important, and making use of a distributed set of APIs could leave you in the unenviable position of being less stable than your least stable partner. The issue of lock-in could also raise itâ€™s head, without a vibrant ecosystem of different providers that is.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>The use of third party commercial APIs has the potential to change the development landscape â€“ bringing high quality middleware to the web. It could be the original web services dream realised. But without critical mass and an active market it could also be a new achilles heel for successful startups.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had need recently to produce some nice looking charts and immediately turned to the very nice <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Charts <span class="caps">API</span></a>. Just before Christmas <a href="http://suda.co.uk">Brian</a> had written up <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/tracking-christmas-cheer-with-google-charts">a great introduction</a> on <a href="http://24ways.org">24ways</a> and ever since I&#8217;d been looking for an excuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com">Chris</a> wrote up a pretty nice approach to <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2008/01/08/generating-charts-from-accessible-data-tables-using-the-google-charts-api/">enhancing well marked up data tables</a> using the Charts <span class="caps">API</span> with a dash of Javascript and I decided to start with that. I made only a couple of changes to this approach based on personal requirements and preferences.</p>
<p>For a table like this:</p>
<table class="tochart">
  <caption>Caption</caption>  
<tr>
    <th scope="row">Label</th>
    <td>Data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th scope="row">Label</th>
    <td>Data</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I prefer to use the table header element to mark up the table row and the original script relied on these being <em>td</em> elements. A couple of changes to the javascript fixed that. I also decided to display the <em>caption</em> as a title on the resulting graph.</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;table class="tochart"&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Caption&lt;/caption&gt;  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;

<p>The original script only supported the 3D pie charts and in a couple of cases I wanted to generate bar-charts from the data or flat pie-charts. A few modifications later and you can pass a type parameter into the script via a class on the table.</p>
<p>The default if the parameter isn&#8217;t set is the flat pie-chart, which can also be specified via:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typep"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For the 3D pie-chart:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typep3"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The horizontal bar-chart is created with:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typebhg"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And finally the vertical bar-chart is set based on:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typebvg"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The complete modified version of Chris&#8217; script is below:</p>
<pre><code>(table2graph = function(){

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m starting to get excited about <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a>. But first a bit of back-story.</p>
<p>I started out making the trip to <a href="http://atmedia2005.co.uk/">@media 2005</a> and since then have been a regular attendee of more conferences than I can shake a stick at. Lets say I caught the conference bug. But most of those have been within the web standards community niche and more recently I&#8217;ve been looking further afield for conference kicks, party due to the eclectic nature of <a href="http://barcamp.org">BarCamp</a> style events. Anyone in that positions inevitably takes a fancy to going along to <a href="http://www.ted.com/"><span class="caps">TED</span></a>. The <em>only</em> problem is the fact it&#8217;s already booked up until 2010, costs $6,000 just to for a standard membership and is invite only.</p>
<p>This year the folks over at <a href="http://codeworks.net">Codeworks</a>, which is a regional body set up to help us North East digital folk develop an industry, are organising their very own full size conference. The <a href="http://thinkandadrink.com">Think and a Drink</a> events have been running for a number of years and I&#8217;ve spoken a few times on web related bits and pieces. But these are purposely local events mainly for members and tend to crop up at the rate of once a month. <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a> is a full size, 400 person, conference being held in Newcastle between the 21st and 23rd of May this year covering a similar set of wide ranging themes to <span class="caps">TED</span>; technology, design, mobile plus a bit of philosophy and futurism thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Now this is good for a few reasons. Only one of which is I can see the venue out of my apartment window. Costing only Â£475 and being in the UK would be a couple of other reasons to get excited. As an aside; I&#8217;m helping out as a board member along with the likes of <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com/">Ian Forrester</a> but I&#8217;d gladly pay my way if I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The real reason for the excitement though is the calibre of some of the speakers. Ray Kurzweil, Greg Dyke, Dan Lyons (a.k.a. Fake Steve Jobs), Matt Locke, Aubrey De Grey and Tara Hunt to name a few I&#8217;m particularly interested in. And remember folks, this is in Newcastle. Which for the few Londoners reading is a couple of hours North of you. On a train with free wifi even.</p>
<p>Now this might not be a web conference but I&#8217;m pretty interested in the take of the likes of Ray Kurzweil on the web and what will happen in the near future. I&#8217;m also interested in the types of people who will make the trip &#8211; which is really the reason for this post. As everyone knows, one of the best parts of any conference is the chance to chat with like-minded (and not so like-minded) folks. So, who fancies coming along?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org">SemanticCamp</a> me and <a href="http://icepop.org/">Rey</a> popped in to see <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/">Paul</a> and everyone at <a href="http://www.osmosoft.com/">Osmosoft</a> towers. A good few interesting conversations ensued, including one about the difference between <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/02/19/mashup-or-integration/">mashups and integration</a>. All good fun basically. <a href="http://simonmcmanus.com/">Simon</a> also had an <a href="http://simonmcmanus.com/2008/02/21/off-the-shelf-integration-in-enterprises/">interesting take on the topic</a> as well.</p>
<p>What has all this to do with the topic of this post? Well, Simon says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When compared to small RESTful APIs like flickr and twitter&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not really picking on Simon here, more that I&#8217;ve been meaning to write something on this topic for a while and this proved a good catalyst for a little rant.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/"><span class="caps">API</span></a> is pretty darn cool. But it&#8217;s not RESTful in pretty much any way you want to shake a stick at it. It&#8217;s a well designed <span class="caps">RPC</span> (remote procedure call) <span class="caps">API</span>. Now even flickr get this wrong. They even have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/response.rest.html">a page</a> which confuses the issue and makes <span class="caps">REST</span> out to be a response format based on <span class="caps">XML</span>. Bad flickr.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/request.rest.html">flickr states</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">REST</span> Endpoint <span class="caps">URL</span> is http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This turns out to be completely against the whole RESTful principles. Lets try and explain. You can define most of what you want to do with an <span class="caps">API</span> with the use of nouns, verbs and content types. <span class="caps">REST</span> is based around limiting the set of verbs to those available in <span class="caps">HTTP</span>; for instance <span class="caps">GET</span>, <span class="caps">POST</span>, <span class="caps">PUT</span> and <span class="caps">DELETE</span>. For any given application or <span class="caps">API</span> you&#8217;ll also specify a set of content types (representations); for instance <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">JSON</span> or <span class="caps">XML</span>. All you get to play around with are the nouns, in the case of the web these are our URLs.</p>
<p>In a typical <span class="caps">RPC</span> style <span class="caps">API</span> you have one <span class="caps">URL</span> (like flickr does) which acts as the end point to which all calls are made. You then probably define a few functions which you can call. Lets look at a simple book example.</p>
<pre><code>getBook()
deleteBook()
createBook()
editBook()</code></pre>
<p>The RESTful way of designing this might look a little bit more like this:</p>
<pre><code>GET     /books/{book-id}
DELETE  /books/{book-id}
POST    /books
PUT     /books/{book-id}</code></pre>
<p>We mentioned content types or representations earlier. Lets say instead of the default response format we might want to get a <span class="caps">JSON</span> representation of a given book we might do something like the following.</p>
<pre><code>GET /books/{book-id}.json</code></pre>
<p>The advantages of using URLs as the <span class="caps">API</span> nouns in this way include more than just sane URLs for the site or application in question. The web is based around many of these architectural principles and that seemed to scale pretty well. The idea is that fell envisaged RESTful applications have an advantage here too. For me one of the real benefits of RESTful APIs are in the simplicity they bring to documentation. I already know the available verbs, all I need to know are the set of resource URLs and I can probably use <span class="caps">CURL</span> to work out the <span class="caps">REST</span> (sorry, bad pun).</p>
<p>This misunderstanding is pretty common. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">WikiPedia</a> appreciates their is a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between the uses of the term â€œRESTâ€ causes some confusion in technical discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just pedantry on my part, well not quite. I&#8217;d recommend anyone involved in designing and architecting web sites read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260">RESTful Web Services</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/">Roy Fielding&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>. But if you just want to <em>get</em> the general principles and don&#8217;t fancy wading through technical documents then you have to read <a href="http://tomayko.com/articles/2004/12/12/rest-to-my-wife">How I Explained <span class="caps">REST</span> to My Wife</a> hilariously written by <a href="http://tomayko.com/">Ryan Tomayko</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, just because an <span class="caps">API</span> makes use of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> doesn&#8217;t make it RESTful. I&#8217;m looking at you <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a great time at <a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org/">SemanticCamp</a> over the weekend which was not too much of a surprise. What was a surprise was getting back home to find out that I&#8217;ve been invited to join the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> (WaSP) on the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/action/edutf">Education Task Force</a>. I even have my <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/grushgrove/">own page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for inviting me guys. Anyone who has had the misfortune of having me present during a discussion of the current state of web education knows it&#8217;s one of my favourite subjects. Hopefully I can make myself useful around the place and help with getting a few things done. More on this when I know more but in the meantime feel free to pester me endlessly if you have a particular axe to grind.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://live.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Live</a> launched recently along with a nice <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ylive/rest_api/">RESTful <span class="caps">API</span></a>. I&#8217;ve spoken before about the beauty of <span class="caps">REST</span> being in lowering the barrier to hacking and when I wanted a quick feature for Live it was simplicity itself to put together.</p>
<p>A few friends are using it far too much it seems, <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/">Ben</a> has 7.6 hours and <a href="http://simonjobling.com">Si</a> has already clocked up 15 hours. But for the most part I keep missing their no-doubt highly entertaining antics. One thing that Live misses I feel is a favourite users or previously viewed channels list. Basically I want to see which of my friends who use the service are broadcasting right now. Something like:</p>
<p><a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/yahoolive/"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080213-q7ntrbip3rhwbkdbykuwt4an5.render.png" alt="Yahoo! Live Online"/></a></p>
<p>The <span class="caps">API</span> request we&#8217;re interested in is the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ylive/rest_api/channel.html">/channel/<span class="caps">PERMALINK</span></a> method. This lets us get information about whether the user is broadcasting at the moment.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
$api = 'http://api.live.yahoo.com/api/v1/channel';
$friends = array(
  'garethr',
  'benward',
  'sijobling'
);
$statuses = array();
foreach ($friends as $friend) { 
  $response = simplexml_load_file($api . '/' . $friend);
  $name = $response-&gt;name; 
  if ($response-&gt;broadcast) {
    $status = 'live';
  } else {
    $status = 'offline';
  }
  $statuses["$name"] = $status;
}
function displaylist($array) {
  $output = '';
  if (count($array) &gt;= 0) {
    $output .= '&lt;ul&gt;';
    foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $value) {
      $output .= "&lt;li class=\"$value\"&gt;";
      $output .= "&lt;a href=\"http://live.yahoo.com/$key\"&gt;";
      $output .= "$key&lt;/a&gt;";
      $output .= "&lt;span&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;";
    }
    $output .= '&lt;/ul&gt;';
  }
  return $output;
}
echo displaylist($statuses);
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ll add a few more people to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/yahoolive/">my list</a> when I discover other people using the service. If you have an account leave a comment. I&#8217;ve added a touch of javascript as well so as to avoid having to reload the page manually. This way I can loiter on my little aggregator until someone I know starts broadcasting and head over to Live for whatever Si has been spending 15 hours doing.</p></div>
