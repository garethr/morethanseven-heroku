  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like small. I have a macbook rather than a macbook pro because it&#8217;s smaller. Especially now I&#8217;m wandering about more often with work (and play) lugging a machine around is less and less appealing. So, armed with that excuse I felt justified in going out and buying a new <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com">Asus Eee PC</a>. I managed to just walk in to <a href="www.microanvika.com/">Micro Anvika</a> in Newcastle and buy one from a bemused staff member who  was pretty shocked to find one in stock and not allocated (sorry <a href="http://www.reyhan.org/">Rey</a>).</p>
<p>For anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen one before, the Eee PC is a tiny linux laptop a little like the One Laptop Per Child machine but aimed more at traditional computer users (at the moment read <em>early adopting geeks</em>). The distro is setup to be pretty user friendly for those pesky Windows users but a little hacking turns it into a pretty darn nice machine.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgEeepcApple.jpg" title="My new eeepc with an apple logo on the back" alt="My new eeepc with an apple logo on the back" /></p>
<p>And yes, I have stuck an apple sticker on back. I&#8217;m sure that should get some entertained looks next time I&#8217;m at a relevant event! I think the machine itself is actually pretty good looking, but the default desktop themes are all pretty uninspiring.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve stuck with the appliance like IceWM window manager and the launcher application as it makes starting things up from the keyboard with one hand pretty fast. I then jumped into various hidden away files to get the desktop setup how I like. The <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com">wiki</a> over on <a href="http://eeeuser.com">eee user</a> has a number of useful tutorials; <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:customizeeasymode">customising easy mode</a> and the debian repo from <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:installruby">a ruby tutorial</a> were particularly handy.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgEeepcDesktop.jpg" title="Minimal IceWM desktop with Asus Launcher" alt="Minimal IceWM desktop with Asus Launcher" /></p>
<p>Still lots more I could install (this is Linux after all) but so far have installed Ruby, Rails, Python, Django, Erlang, MySQL, SQLite, Apache2, PHP5, <span class="caps">PEAR</span> and symfony all without a hitch. I do love apt when it just works. I&#8217;ll try and get Mono and Java on their as well just for completeness when I get a moment.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of that I&#8217;ll really miss at the moment is Keynote. It has a <span class="caps">VGA</span> out port (which not even the macbook has) which will support a decent resolution for presentations. But Keynote is so pretty and easy to use compared to the alternatives. We&#8217;ll have to see next time I have to do a presentation.</p>
<p>I can see lots of places (past the obsessive tech geeks like me) where a machine like this will be really interesting. Obviously the low cost of the machine means that schools might just get interested in Linux. For people who prefer a desktop machine as their main computer and only occasionally need a laptop it&#8217;s a pretty cost effective option. As a machine to experiment with Linux it&#8217;s pretty useful too &#8211; I&#8217;d recommend being familiar with basic commands on Linux to anyone doing web development work for instance. With so many possible audiences, and what is already a pretty nice machine, Asus might be onto something here.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those not following along closely I thought it worth highlighting some interesting goings on around the web. <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> put the <span class="caps">CSS</span> cat amongst the W3C pigeons with a couple of posts; <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/css_unworking_group/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Unworking Group</a> and a following up <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/csswg_proposals/"><span class="caps">CSSWG</span> Proposals</a></p>
<p>How I&#8217;ve had a <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/css-snapshots-css3-modules-and-an-agile-way-forward/">few ideas</a> myself previously around what I&#8217;d like to see from the CSS3 working group. I&#8217;m now avidly following along with <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/comments/csswg_proposals/">the comments</a> and I&#8217;d urge anyone working even on an occasional basis with <span class="caps">CSS</span> to do the same.</p>
<p><a href="http://webkit.org/blog/">Maciej Stachowiak</a> said a few very interesting things in the comments I thought worth commenting on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being an expert user is not necessarily enough to know how to extend it. A key part of extending a technology is knowing how it works on the inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think their-in lies an opportunity. The weight of comments on this issue, and the heat of the argument, would suggest people are interested. But I think a-lot of those interested parties are those working day-in with <span class="caps">CSS</span> (rather than on it) and lack this critical information. As a web designer how do I find this information out? Who are the interesting bloggers in the area of standardisation? Is their are good reference site? Or a wiki? Or an active friendly mailing list of people willing to answer simple questions? The web (standards) design community is used to open discussion and debate &#8211; whether from blogs or projects like <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a>.</p>
<p>You could of course also argue that <em>being an expert implementer is not necessarily enough to know what needs extending. A key part of extending a technology is knowing what is needed first in the real world</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the cost of a serious mistake in a standard is much higher than the cost of an implementation bug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this depends on the software in question &#8211; what about critical military systems, satellites or space shuttles, power stations, etc. &#8211; but I agree in principle. Most web designers do not have the experience of working on this sort of software project. But then Andy is not putting himself up as a project management guru.</p>
<p>Their are obviously strong feelings on both sides of this debate. But something I would be interested to hear &#8211; from someone with a standards focus &#8211; is whether you think their is a fundamental problem at the moment with regards <span class="caps">CSS</span>? If not then why not? If so then what are your ideas for moving forward?</p>
<p>And feel free to say you don&#8217;t know yet. I think what Andy has done is put down his ideas. If you don&#8217;t like them then suggest better ones. If that&#8217;s sticking to the status quo then say why you it feel will work out.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve posted the above in the comments to the original post, but wanted to repeat it here more in the hope of getting more interested people involved in that thread.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really expect Andy to have the answers to this issue, but by him kicking the discussion off in such a public way the least we can <em>all</em> do is have the debate we need and come up with the solutions for everyone. Especially on the  list of <em>getting started with standards</em> links and reading materials alluded to above, if someone has this information but not the time to get it online in a coherent fashion, or to present it to the wider community then please get in touch.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a big big fan of all things <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, the new <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> based database, <a href="http://couchdb.org">CouchDB</a>, piqued my interest. With the recent <a href="http://damienkatz.net/2007/11/couchdb_070.html">release of 0.7</a> it&#8217;s now intended for widespread use. Now I&#8217;m a fan of databases as long as I don&#8217;t have to go too near them. <span class="caps">SQL</span>, triggers and stored procedures are all a little too close to magic for me.</p>
<p>The reason CouchDB looks particularly good fun was it&#8217;s build around a <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> using <span class="caps">JSON</span> for data transport. I&#8217;m generally not an acronym guy, but <span class="caps">REST</span>, <span class="caps">JSON</span>, <span class="caps">API</span> and <span class="caps">HTTP</span> in one open source piece of code? Sounds like fun to me.</p>
<p>The CouchDB community have built up an already <a href="http://www.couchdbwiki.com/">excellent wiki</a> with all the information you need to get started and get the <a href="http://www.couchdbwiki.com/index.php?title=Installation">software installed</a>. I just used the magic of <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> but the page covers all the various dependencies and setups (though nothing on their yet about the N800).</p>
<pre><code>sudo port install couchdb</code></pre>
<p>You might then need to set-up a user and some permissions. Again the wiki has more <a href="http://www.couchdbwiki.com/index.php?title=Installation#Security_Considerations">detailed installation instructions</a>. All being well you should then be able to fire up CouchDB:</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u couchdb couchdb</code></pre>
<p>So first things first. Their are getting started code examples on the wiki in all the usual languages so you can just dive in. CouchDB also comes with a few in-build tools which are both pretty attractive and useful. You have a <a href="http://localhost:8888/_utils/browse/index.html">database browser</a>, a full <a href="http://localhost:8888/_utils/couch_tests.html">test suite</a> and a <a href="http://localhost:8888/_utils/shell.html">command shell</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">Curl</a>, for those not familiar with it, is a fantastic command line utility for throwing around <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests. I already use it for testing and generally prodding sites but it&#8217;s absolutely perfect for demonstrating CouchDB. Let&#8217;s start with creating a database called <em>test</em>:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X PUT http://localhost:8888/test/</code></pre>
<p>That should have created the database. Let&#8217;s get some information back about the database:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/test/</code></pre>
<p>Everything should be returning <span class="caps">JSON</span> strings telling us something about what it finds. Let&#8217;s add a blank document to the database:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/test/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d {}</code></pre>
<p>Note the blank <span class="caps">JSON</span> object <em>{}</em> passed as Post data. What about retrieving a list of document from the database?</p>
<pre><code>curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/test/_all_docs</code></pre>
<p>We&#8217;re now done with that database so let&#8217;s delete it.</p>
<pre><code>curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8888/test/</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve just done the basics here, but the APIs are simple and nicely documented enough for you easily to find out more. This is the beauty of RESTfully designed APIs, they are just about self documenting. For the most part you just have a predefined <span class="caps">HTTP</span> method and a defined <span class="caps">URL</span>.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.couchdbwiki.com/index.php?title=HTTP_View_API"><span class="caps">HTTP</span> View <span class="caps">API</span></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.couchdbwiki.com/index.php?title=HTTP_Doc_API"><span class="caps">HTTP</span> Doc <span class="caps">API</span></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.couchdbwiki.com/index.php?title=HTTP_Db_API"><span class="caps">HTTP</span> DB <span class="caps">API</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Erlang base of CouchDB makes for some interesting horizontal scaling possibilities (as well as a good excuse to play with Erlang.) Even if CouchDB wasn&#8217;t cool enough already, it comes with probably the best start-up message I&#8217;ve seen in software for ages:</p>
<pre><code>CouchDB has started. Time to relax.</code></pre></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As well as the eclectic ramblings on this blog I&#8217;ve taken to writing longer bits and pieces for some other nice folk, two of which went up over the last few days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drew&#8221; and <a href="http://suda.co.uk">Brian</a> are doing a great job of gathering together some really good articles in a silly time-scale over on <a href="http://24ways.org">24ways.org</a> at the moment. <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/minification-a-christmas-diet">My little ditty on minification</a> was day 6.</p>
<p><a href="http://my.opera.com/chrismills/blog/">Chris Mills</a>, in his new position as Opera mascot, has also rapidly started to build up a great collection of articles over on <a href="http://dev.opera.com">dev.opera</a>. My contribution to what is looking like a great new resource is a piece on <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/json-configuration-for-javascript/">using <span class="caps">JSON</span> for configuration in your Javascript applications</a>.</p>
<p>Writing for other people is different to just posting interesting stuff on your blog. And it wouldn&#8217;t work at all without some pretty dedicated people editing, compiling and chasing to get us all those high quality articles for sites such as <a href="http://alistapart.com">alistapart</a>, <a href="http://digital-web.com">Digital Web</a> and <a href="http://sitepoint.com">Sitepoint</a>. So if you meet any of these people on your travels then pat them on the back and <a href="http://foamee.com">buy them a beer</a>. Without the information sharing community we probably wouldn&#8217;t be doing all this for a living.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve talked about <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/debug-web-pages-with-jquery-and-jash/">having fun with jQuery</a> using <a href="http://www.billyreisinger.com/jash/">Jash</a> and Firebug before after seeing <a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a> throw the Google homepage around at barcamp. I&#8217;m no more a one javascript framework person than a one programming language person and recently I&#8217;ve seen cool things I want to play with in lots of the main contenders.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve put together a couple of bookmarklets which load <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"><span class="caps">YUI</span></a> or <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> from their respective content delivery networks and insert them into your current browser context. You can then play around with them in Jash or Firebug or any other Javascript console.</p>
<p>Dojo is particularly interesting here due to it&#8217;s cunning loading mechanism for additional parts of the framework. Basically you can gain access to the entire (huge) framework simply by using the bookmarklet and then dynamically loading the rest via the command line.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:void(function(){var%20s=document.createElement('script');s.src='http://o.aolcdn.com/dojo/1.0.0/dojo/dojo.xd.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);}())">Insert Dojo</a></p>
<pre><code>javascript:void(function(){
 var%20s=document.createElement('script');
 s.src='http://o.aolcdn.com/dojo/1.0.0/dojo/dojo.xd.js';
 document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);
}())</code></pre>
<p><a href="javascript:void(function(){var%20s=document.createElement('script');s.src='http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);}())">Insert <span class="caps">YUI</span></a></p>
<pre><code>javascript:void(function(){
 var%20s=document.createElement('script');
 s.src='http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js';
 document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);
}())</code></pre>
<p>The code simply inserts a script element into the page which loads the relevant framework. I&#8217;ve shown the code on multiple lines for the sake of the example, but your bookmarklet should be on one line. Alternatively you can drag the <a href="javascript:void(function(){var%20s=document.createElement('script');s.src='http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.0/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);}())">Insert <span class="caps">YUI</span></a> or <a href="javascript:void(function(){var%20s=document.createElement('script');s.src='http://o.aolcdn.com/dojo/1.0.0/dojo/dojo.xd.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);}())">Insert Dojo</a> links to your bookmark bar.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a new toy I&#8217;m quite enamoured with. After a double helping of <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> first from <a href="http://ejohn.org">Jon Resig</a> at @media Ajax and then from <a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon Willison</a> at barcamp I just had to take a look. My favourite part was probably Simon showing off his <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2007/Aug/15/jquery/">Insert jQuery</a> bookmarklet &#8211; hacking around with the Google home page design on the firebug command line. The idea of having a command line to play around with any web page I come across appeals to my geekier side.</p>
<p>I spend more time in Safari than Firefox these days mainly as I find it <em>feels</em> snappier and is generally more stable. The only real downside is the lag of Firebug. A quick look at <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/lite.html">Firebug Lite</a> revealed it doesn&#8217;t work in Safari but a little searching later I found <a href="http://www.billyreisinger.com/jash/">Jash</a>. The Insert jQuery and Insert Jash bookmarklets now have pride of place in my bookmark bar.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgJqueryAndJash.jpg" title="&quot;Jquery and Jash bookmarklets running on Google&quot;" alt="&quot;Jquery and Jash bookmarklets running on Google&quot;" /></p>
<p>So what to do with my new toy? Let&#8217;s hide all the paragraphs! (for no other reasons than we can).</p>
<pre><code>$("p").hide("slow")</code></pre>
<p>So, redesign any web page you visit via a quick to access command line? What&#8217;s not to like?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The resent <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon">barcamplondon3</a> was huge fun and particularly interesting. I might even go as far as saying it was the best yet in terms of the sessions I attended.</p>
<p>Particular highlights for me included discussions of (Yahoo! flavoured) web development practices and processes from <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Norm</a> and <a href="http://isolani.co.uk/">Mike</a>, <a href="http://hackdiary.com">Matt Biddulph</a> on messaging, erlang a event driven programming techniques and <a href="http://www.digitaldust.org/">Dan Dixon&#8217;s</a> panel on What should we be teaching the next gen of web designers/devs?</p>
<p>I tried to kick off a debate regarding automation and software tools and practices in web projects. More from anecdotal evidence and experience rather than pure research I don&#8217;t think that many companies or individuals really set their projects up on a solid base. Source control, bug tracking, scripted builds, automated quality testing, etc. aren&#8217;t that common for smaller or medium web projects.</p>
<p>In the end I talked though everything in general terms and the audience nicely jumped in with various platform specific toolsets for unit testing, functional testing and performance measurement. All in all good fun and a subject I think will see some activity next year.</p>
<div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_187152"><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=things-you-probably-dont-do-or-tying-to-make-project-automation-sexy-1196432405301568-3"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=things-you-probably-dont-do-or-tying-to-make-project-automation-sexy-1196432405301568-3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object><div style="font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed"><img src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png" style="border:0px none;margin-bottom:-5px" alt="SlideShare"/></a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/things-you-probably-dont-do-or-tying-to-make-project-automation-sexy" title="View 'Things you probably don't do (or tying to make project automation sexy)' on SlideShare">View</a> | <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/upload">Upload your own</a></div></div>
<p>Overall a good smattering of my favourite topics at the moment (education, development process, distributed messaging), lots of fun people and the chance to ride round Google on a segway at about two in the morning. Roll on the next barcamp.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.al3x.net/">Alex</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> just got round to adding the ability to export your entire archive of tweets via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/web/api-documentation"><span class="caps">API</span></a>. A few people on the mailing list had been asking for this for a while so good to see it get released.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t resist knocking together a very quick and simple Python script to go off and get all your tweets, presented here for anyone else to play around with. Note that simple, fast and works on my machine were watchwords here. Don&#8217;t expect fancy parameters, much error handling or artificial intelligence.</p>
<% syntax_colorize :python, type=:coderay do %>
import urllib2
username = &#8217;<YOUR USERNAME>&#8217;
password = &#8217;<YOUR PASSWORD>&#8217;
format = &#8216;json&#8217; # json or xml
filename = &#8216;archive.json&#8217; # filename of the archive
tweets = 164 # number of tweets
pages = (int(float(tweets)/float(80)))+1
auth = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()
auth.add_password(None, &#8216;http://twitter.com/account/&#8217;, username, password)
authHandler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(auth)
opener = urllib2.build_opener(authHandler)
urllib2.install_opener(opener) 
i = 1
response = &#8221;
print &#8216;Downloading tweets. Note that this may take some time&#8217;
while i <= pages:
    request = urllib2.Request('http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/account.' \
    + format + '?page=' + str(i))
    response = response + urllib2.urlopen(request).read()
    i = i + 1
handle = open(filename,"w")
handle.write(response)
handle.close()
print 'Archived ' + str(tweets) + ' of ' + username + \
'\'s tweets to ' + filename
<% end %>
<p>The main thing to note here though is the ideal of <a href="http://www.dataportability.org/">data portability</a>. Let&#8217;s just say I wanted to move to Jaiku or Pownce instead of Twitter, but didn&#8217;t want to lose all that data. If I can knock up an export script in half an hour then all you need are import data <span class="caps">API</span> calls and a little more scripting.</p>
<p>As it is, I&#8217;m more interesting in seeing what I can do with my data now I can get at it. <a href="http://suda.co.uk">Brian</a> just suggested a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">quick visualisation tool</a> (which already eats <span class="caps">JSON</span>) and I&#8217;d already been thinking about <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/pygunfog/">language analysis</a> and maybe having a look at <a href="http://www.apml.org/"><span class="caps">APML</span></a> some more. Open data is simply more fun.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a wandering web designer cum developer and now occasional consultant I&#8217;m generally pretty technology agnostic. At some point or another I&#8217;ve written <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, Javascript, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, C#, Python and Rails for a living &#8211; often on the same day. But something has me thinking and I thought I&#8217;d see what other people thought as well.</p>
<p>That thing is <em>Java</em>. I have books on Java. I&#8217;ve done the usual examples (hello world in 20 lines for instance). I didn&#8217;t really like it and left it at that. But a few presentations, both from Google, at both <a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile</a> and <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/">@media Ajax</a> got me thinking. First you have <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> in the mobile space which Dave Burke did a good job of making look pretty interesting. Then you had the guys from <a href="http://ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a> talking about using Java for <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">everything</a>.</p>
<p>A few other thinks to throw into the pot. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Java-Bruce-Tate/dp/0596100949">Beyond Java</a> is an interesting read &#8211; summing up with a call for more fragmentation and for small nimble languages to be used where it makes sense. Oh, and I think <a href="http://tommorris.org/blog/">Tom</a> is busy learning Java as well. Mmmmm.</p>
<p>Some good coverage around of <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/ajaxising/">both</a> <a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/msjen/2007/11/london-day-6-future.html#more">conferences</a> and I know my first impression was basically <em>this way lies madness</em>. But it would have been more interesting had their been a few more Java people around to argue with.</p>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m not advocating a Google like disregard for the web here. Markup really matters, I happen to disagree with <a href="http://crockford.com/">Douglas</a> and think <span class="caps">CSS</span> rocks and I love writing Javascript. But should we just learn Java anyhow and try to subvert some of the existing tools to be more web like?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent yesterday afternoon over with <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a> in London as part of their UK developer day. The event was mainly for them to show off their new widget platform and to get some input from prospective developers about what they would like to see next. About 20 people or so came along from the <span class="caps">BBC</span>, Ebay and a couple of london agencies, with me and <a href="http://tommorris.org/">Tom</a> loitering around the edges. The afternoon was split into a series of short talks from people on the team. What follows is some of the interesting bits.</p>
<p>Joost describe themselves as <em>The Best of the Internet and best of TV</em>, if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet it&#8217;s basically TV running on the Mozilla platform. All in all pretty impressive. <a href="http://danbri.org">Dan Brickley</a> had a different slant, seeing Joost as Web 2.0 +/- 1 <em>Built and extended with modern web technology, modern web attitude</em>. The idea of taking an unashamedly desktop piece of software and learning lessons from the web is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dev.joost.com">Joost development site</a> is now public, although not linked to from the main site as yet. Their is some documentation of the various APIs but we can expect more in the future, including some videos from the developer days in a development channel.</p>
<p>The main emphasis for developers at this moment was on overlays and widgets (<em>little bundles of web technology</em>) which integrate with the Joost client. We got a sneak peak (and a chat with some of the developers) of the first commercial Joost widget for Coca Cola &#8211; <a href="http://cokebubbles.com">Coke Bubbles</a> and <a href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/~ecemm/">Libby Miller</a> and <a href="http://jibbering.com">Jim Ley</a> showed off a few of the default widgets.</p>
<p>The most interesting bits from my point of view were to do with the technology. Joost has an interesting advantage as a platform being a single, dedicated client. No more cross browser testing here. They also keep  pretty close to trunk for Mozilla, which gives them quite a bit of CSS3 support too. You can also try out other new technologies not available in too many browsers yet: <span class="caps">SVG</span>, <span class="caps">RDF</span>, Canvas and E4X for example. This was the second time in a few days I&#8217;d seen <span class="caps">SVG</span> pushed as cool, the first being at Future of Mobile which I&#8217;ll jot down some thoughts on later.</p>
<p>What was interesting was that the people along from the development team came from a W3C background rather than say an product development or design companies. Joost makes extensive use of Semantic Web technologies under the hood and exposes quite a bit of RDFa if you go looking for it. It also follows along with various other web-like ideas, unique URLs for channels and programmes, including the ability to pass these parameters for instance to deep link into a video at a current time. The widget platform as well is starting to align with standards work going on at the W3C &#8211; we saw a quick demo of a widget build for the Opera browser which worked seamlessly with Joost too. The development team are now working on dealing with signed widgets, local storage APIs, interwidget communication, as well as usable, clear privacy models. All pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Some of the event was hampered by a shoddy internet connection but the general mood was relaxed and friendly and no one seemed to mind too much. The beer probably helped. I did chuckle when a senior alternative marketing guy from Coke described as <em>Insane</em> the typical agency setup though (rich guy in Notting Hill &#8594; account manager &#8594; project manager &#8594; developers).</p>
<p>Their will be a Coke sponsored widget competition announced after the rest of the developer days (in Amsterdam and New York) with the title of <em>International widgets champion of Joost</em> up for grabs along with some cash and <em>a t-shirt</em>.</p>
<p>My only real complaint was probably the low level mutterings about Javascript! Audience members and Joost developers alike made a couple of digs during the course of the day. Javascript rocks, people. Oh well, I&#8217;m back in London for <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmediaAjax">@media Ajax</a> where I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have that problem.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds interesting (or you just want to watch more TV) I&#8217;d recommend having a look through the <a href="http://dev.joost.com">development site</a>, jumping on the joost-dev freenode <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel, signing up to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/joost-dev">mailing list</a> or reading the <a href="http://blogs.joost.com/dev">development teams blog</a>.</p></div>
