  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve posted a list before of events and meetups I know about around the UK but had got playing with the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/">Google Maps <span class="caps">API</span></a> and decided to go one stage further and create a hopefully useful place to put all that info in the shape of a quick mashup.</p>
<p>Have a look over on <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/meetup">morethanseven.net/presents/meetup</a> for a hopefully useful tool. I&#8217;ll try and keep this up to date manually for the time being, so if you know of any other get togethers please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll add them to the list. Thanks to the excellent, if a little technical (well, it is Google) <span class="caps">API</span> documentation and <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://austin.adactio.com">Adactio Austin</a> for inspiration.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgMapSample.jpg" title="Sample map of UK Meetups" alt="Sample map of UK Meetups" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to make this even more flexible, ideally all I should have to do is point the page at the group urls and then parse out the geo-coded microformats data and then display it on the map and page, rather than duplicate this information and maintain it by hand. So if any of the owners of these sites want to geo-code up their sites and let me know that would be great. Some <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming</a> integration might be on the cards too.</p>
<p>Hopefully it should be of some use to anyone looking for things going on in their area, or if you find yourself in a strange part of the country for whatever reasons then you&#8217;ll know how to find the local geek community without risking life and limb with an odd T-Shirt.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quite a bit of time at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">BarCamp</a> was spent thinking, talking and in running skirmishes about the Semantic Web. Or the semantic web depending which <em>side</em> you&#8217;re on.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m a big fan and perpetual user of <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a>. They make sense, are simple to add everywhere (by stealth if needs be) and the potential is pretty interesting to boot. They are designed in the open, allowing everyone to participate and have a strong emphasis on solving every day problems in the real world.</p>
<p>Contrast that with <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><span class="caps">RDF</span></a> and the Semantic Web. Most of the work here has been going on for years in academic institutions and W3C working groups. It&#8217;s all rather grandiose. Everything I&#8217;d seen previously horribly broke <span class="caps">HTML</span>. But someone seems to have seen the light. <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/tommorris/">Tom Morris</a> mentioned in one of his talks <a href="http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml">eRDF</a>, which is a method for embedding <span class="caps">RDF</span> in <em>valid</em> <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
<p>After one of the talks I got chatting with Tom Morris and <a href="http://www.kid666.com/blog/">Tom Croucher</a>, both card carrying <span class="caps">RDF</span> folk, and <a href="http://niquimerret.com/">Niqui Merret</a> another interested bystander. Toms argument basically comes down to Microformats solve the 80% problem, <span class="caps">RDF</span> trys to solve the other 20%. I sort of think the Microformats group would probably agree with that. I also like the idea of creating your own formats off the cuff. I&#8217;ve seen enough to at least have a further look see and hopefully try out a few experiements myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/">Ben Ward</a> had a <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/fao-rdf/">few things to say on the subject</a> which are worth a good read. I agree with the majority of his arguments but coudn&#8217;t resist commenting on at least one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If youâ€™re working with <span class="caps">RDF</span>, show me something new. Donâ€™t just rehash vcard and icalendar into your own format; Iâ€™m not interested</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree. One of the best thinks about Microformats, that draw people (including me) in from the get go, is the unquestionable ease with which you can add <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hcard</a> or <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">xfn</a> and get on with your day. Weeks or months later, after a few feel good projects you&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on the wiki when you come across something in need of structure. And even then you find it&#8217;s a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume">composite</a> of something you&#8217;ve seen before.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;d love to find that. A simple example of how to mark up a few very simple examples of eRDF. Hey, if that means contact details and a calendar event then so be it. If all that&#8217;s wrapped up in a lovely shiny green coat of pain with an icon logo so much the better. Until I can experiment with simple I cant do anything else, never mind anything new. So that&#8217;s two posts for the future sorted then.</p>
<p>Tom has set up a wiki over at <a href="http://www.getsemantic.com/wiki/Main_Page">GetSemantic</a> to start to collate information together in one place which from my initial research seems like a good idea. If and when I get enough together (and the <a href="http://openid.net">OpenId</a> authentication is up and running) I&#8217;ll make sure to add everything there. If I get carried away and find interesting voices on the blogosphere I might event get a planet up and running. Or I might find way too much <span class="caps">XML</span> and leave it at that.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Meeting likeminded people is always good fun and the UK web conference scene provides lots of good opportunities for that. Sometimes it&#8217;s meeting up with past <em>aquaintances</em> or <em>friends</em> and other times mainly about making new <em>contacts</em>. Oh, and their are always a few <em>co-worker&#8217;s</em> in tow.</p>
<p>Mainly as a reminder but also as a &#8220;hello&#8221; to some of those I met down in London for <a href="http://barcamp.org/barcamplondon2">BarCamp</a> (BarcampLondon2) and <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Apps</a> (FOWALondon07) here goes with a list of some of the people, mainly <em>colleague</em> and a few <em>neighbor</em> I met on my travels:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kid666.com/blog">Tom Croucher</a>, <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/tommorris">Tom Morris</a>, <a href="http://www.garethrodger.com/">Gareth Rogers</a>, <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk">Ben Ward</a>, <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a>, <a href="http://kapowaz.net">Ben Darlow</a>, <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Norm</a>, <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com/">Ian Forrester</a>, <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">Stuart Colville</a>, <a href="http://thedredge.org/">Andy Hume</a>, <a href="http://www.donotremove.co.uk/">Mike Stenhouse</a>, <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">Pete Lambert</a>, Lisa Price, <a href="http://blog.meriwilliams.com/">Meri Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.ellythompson.co.uk/blog/">Elly Williams</a>, <a href="http://nascentguruism.com/">Steve Marshall</a>, <a href="http://niquimerret.com/">Niqui Merret</a>, <a href="http://notes.natbat.net/">Natalie Downe</a>, <a href="http://www.agm.me.uk/blog/">Alistair MacDonald</a>.</p>
<p>Between them they now have me interested in doing more with mobile messaging (<span class="caps">SMS</span>, <span class="caps">MMS</span>, Jabber), finding our more about eRDF, playing with Pipes, organising a Barcamp, getting some Moo cards, playing more with the flickr machine tags api and, oh, about a hundred and one other things including drinking beer (ok, that one was Ben). Consider that a partial list of the sorts of things I&#8217;m likely to post on over the next month or so.</p>
<p>If their is anyone I have yet to add to <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> hopefully I&#8217;ll find you soon or feel free to drop me a line. If I missed someone sorry, probably all the sleep I&#8217;ve been trying to catch up on.</p>
<p>This post brought to you by some of <span class="caps">XFN</span>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I&#8217;m now running <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I know I appear to be aimlessly flitting between content management systems on this site but it&#8217;s more of a little research project I swear. Hopefully it&#8217;s all happening pretty seemlessly for everyone reading my ramblings. This time <span class="caps">RSS</span> came to the fore, allowing me to simply export a feed of all my previous posts and import them straight into WordPress. This sort of portability is very very nice for the user. I&#8217;d love to see this sort of functionality for hierachically structured data in larger enterprise systems.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got Wordpress up and running with a few choice plugins and a new theme in a couple of days which is nice. Hopefully any minor issues will be ironed out as I find them. An added bonus is comments are now back, I&#8217;ve got so many things to rave about after getting back from <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">BarCamp</a> and <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Apps</a> that letting anyone else point out the errors is only fair.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, my presentation over at the local <a href="http://rubyandrails.org/usergroups/newcastle/">Ruby on Rails Usergroup</a> went down OK last Thursday. I could have done with some more time to prepare and do up some nicer slides but most of the presentation was quite hands on with me coding and talking, which was a first for me.</p>
 <p>My presentation was basically a whistle stop tour of <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a>. I rambled on for about fifty minutes or so, quickly going through the basic concepts of Pages, Layouts and Snippets and then on to an example site which I built from scratch in front of everyone &#8211; with only a few obvious errors and obvious mistakes.</p>
 <p>I ended up talking some about ommissions in Radiant, which I&#8217;m not sure I got across as the positive that I feel they are (at least for me). I dont want a fully featured blogging system, rather something that&#8217;s easy enought to jump into somewhere and see how it works. A few ideas came up from this discussion that, given the chance, I&#8217;ll mention on the Radiant mailing lists, or give them a go myself &#8211; like the ability to save configurations of pages, snippets and layouts and then load then instead of one of the three default prepopulation options. Though I&#8217;m busy modding the Radiant commentable behaviour and pondering a move to the Mental release candidate at the moment.</p>
 <p>It at least got me back in to presenting to an industry audience, quite different from the teaching I&#8217;d been doing. Hopefully a good thing ahead of <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">BarCamp</a> in a weeks time.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just back from <a href="//webdd.org.uk">WebDD</a> down in Reading at the Microsoft Campus and thought I&#8217;d post a few thoughts. I&#8217;ll get into a few of these topics in more detail down the line when time permits but for now&#8230;</p>
 <p>I went to a few talks, one on Microformats by <a href="http://www.glennjones.net">Glenn Jones</a> and the other on web standards design by <a href="http://www.splintered.co.uk">Patrick Lauke</a> that I enjoyed but didn&#8217;t learn much. I wasn&#8217;t the intended audience really and I&#8217;d gone along because I didn&#8217;t fancy the alternatives. Both were entertaining and well attended anyhow, and I&#8217;m sure the more developer orientated folk got a lot out of both.</p>
 <p>The main two things I came away thinking about however were the upcoming version of <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700830.aspx">Visual Studio</a> (codename &#8220;Orcas&#8221;) and Microsofts new identity platform <a href="http://cardspace.netfx3.com/">CardSpace</a></p>
 <p>Now I&#8217;m not generally a fan of IDEs, but someone has been thinking <em>alot</em> about how Visual Studio (and the new Expression Web) can be of use to web designers. Some of the <span class="caps">CSS</span> tools are very cool, I might do some screenshot from Expression (we all got free copies) if I get the chance. Their has also been a huge effort to integrate Javascript functionality, including full debugging and breakpoint support as well as intelissense. All of which looks really rather nice.</p>
 <p>According to Microsoft <q><a href="http://cardspace.netfx3.com/">Windows CardSpace</a> enables users to provide their digital identities in a familiar, secure and easy way.</q> Which should have alarm bells going off and (bad) memories of Passport flooding back. I went in not knowing much and in quite a sceptical mood, assuming the worst. Turns out I was wrong. The presentation, by <a href="http://www.idunno.org/">Barry Dorrans</a>, covered quite a bit of ground from an introduction, through code and working examples and even a big discussion of the issue of identity and <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> in particularly. I&#8217;m suprised that I haven&#8217;t seen any mention of CardSpace along with the recent rise in discussion around identity and OpenID. More on this soon.</p>
 <p>One last thing on the WebDD site caught my eye: <q>around 350 people with a 50/50 split of web developers and web designers</q>. In reality I think about 20 of us registered as designers which amused me. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t (yet) have a pull over designers as it does over developers. More on that too when I get my thoughts in order.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, well, that was interesting I thought. For those that haven&#8217;t followed along on the site I thought I&#8217;d recap some of the weird and wonderful colour schemes that have been used on this site as part of my experiment with <a href="http://www.firewheeldesign.com/widgets/">colorburn</a></p>
 <p>Some were just about OK, some were quite nice really and a few were, er, pretty much unreadable (sorry). I&#8217;ll let you decide which where which:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I do quite a bit of big picture web site/application design at work (ok, that probably needs more of a description). I get involved in alot of the details that lie somewhere off to the side of the obvious bits that need to be done (mmm, not much better). All those technologies and tools and ideas only tell part of the story of building a successful site or online application. Even something stringing together a good idea, clean markup, good <span class="caps">CSS</span>, some fancy backend code (insert prefered option) and a sprinkling of user centred design tools can fall down on the hidden details; good form labels, help messages that actually help rather than just repeating the problem, organising file systems to allow for simple scaling, skinning and internationalisation, etc.</p>
 <p><a href="http://plasticbag.org">Tom Coates</a> spoke last year about his concept of <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/files/native/">Native to a Web of Data</a> which really struck a chord at the time, and not just because I still want <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redux/97126279/">this on a t-shirt</a>. More recently the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> has really caught on, especially amongst the dynamic languages crowd &#8211;  you just need to look at Rails 1.2 for an example their. The big picture is <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></a> is back and everyone who didn&#8217;t already get it should be doing some reading.</p>
 <p>Another notable person talking quite a bit about <span class="caps">REST</span>, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> and related issues is <a href="http://bitworking.org">Joe Gregorio</a>. Amongst other interesting posts, I came across one on <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/URI_Templates"><span class="caps">URI</span> Templates</a> a good while ago and have been following the specification to produce recent documentation. The idea is simple and so is the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-00.html">specification</a>. A quick example, for a simple <span class="caps">CRUD</span> interface might be:</p>
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th><span class="caps">URI</span></th>
    <th>Method</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>View</td>
    <td>/view/{id}</td>
    <td>Get</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Add</td>
    <td>/page/add</td>
    <td>Get, Post</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Edit</td>
    <td>/page/edit/{id}</td>
    <td>Get, Post</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>/page/delete/{id}</td>
    <td>Post</td>
</tr>
</table>
 <p>Doing this for a site or application in the early stages of development really helps to highlight what actions are available, and to remove the need for costly changes later in the day. It also helps others learn, mainly through discussion, about the different <span class="caps">HTTP</span> methods and the importance of the <span class="caps">URI</span> in general.</p></div>
